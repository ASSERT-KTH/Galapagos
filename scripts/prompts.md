- intro
    - 'The following code the reference implementation of a C function'

- prompts
    - Create a substitute implementation of the function, which is different but equivalent. It should be possible to directly replace the function and it should provide the same functionality.
    - Give me a semantically equivalent version of the program in the same language. 
    - Use code transformations to produce variants of the original function that would preserve its original functionalities.
    - Explore different forms of program transformations that slightly vary the behavior of the original program while maintaining its initial functionality. Use them to provide a program variant.

    - Give me a semantically equivalent version of the function in the Go programming language.



Do not output any other text apart from the code.
Do not create auxiliary nor helper functions.
Maintain the original function's signature.
