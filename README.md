# ChatGPT4SW


## NOTES 13-04-2023
- The prompt needs the specification about writing only code. This is sanitization in the end.
- With O3, we reach 60% of preservation in machine code. We start to repeat the same source code after the generation number 50.
- The prompt affects the diversification. Second experiment with a different prompt shows that even in the second iteration it generates the same source code. The preservation reaches a 30% the first one, reaches 60%. The main difference are the keywords "different but equivalent".

## RQs:
- To what extent ChatGPT can diversify X, Y, Z ?
    - Different X, language
    - Different Y, program
    - Different X, prompt
