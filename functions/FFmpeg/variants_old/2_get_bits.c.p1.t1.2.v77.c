Here is the variant program of the exact functionality as stated as above. Please note, using if condition to validate an expression instead of av_assert2.


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n) {
    unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);

    if (n <= 0 || n > 25) {
        return -1;
    }

    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);

    if (!(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n)) {
        return -2;
    }  
     
    return tmp;
}

This variant will behave the same as the original function but instead of stopping the program with an assertion error, which could potentially crash the program, it will just safely return an error code `-1` or `-2` when the condition fails or happens something unprecedented. The calling function can then handle these error codes as fit for its use.
