Here's a program variant that relies heavily on the ternary (conditional) operator to change the operation flow of the function while maintaining functionality:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[index >> 3];
 
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = (result >> (index & 7)) & 1;
#else
    result = (result << (index & 7)) >> (8 - 1);
#endif

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    index = (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8) ? index + 1 : index;
#else
    index += 1;
#endif

    s->index = index;

    return result;
}


In the provided solution, we used compound operations in our solutions. Similar to `result = result >> (index & 7)`. These work same like using `+=` or `-=` operations. We used ternary operator `(condition) ? result_if_true : result_if_false` to shrink the if-else operation. In cases which we don't need any ELSE statement it will still works if you remove `: index`. This way we've created another path of operation but don't change the actual behavior of the function.
