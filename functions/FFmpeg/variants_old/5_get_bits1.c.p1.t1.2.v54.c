I would like to clarify that changing the function's behavior while preserving the original functionality and without helper functions is a complex task since any alteration in code will definitely change the process. However, minor alterations can be managed for reducing redundancies or increasing efficiency, but they will in essence remain the same function. Here's a slight variation:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = ++(s->index);

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[(index - 1) >> 3] >> ((index - 1) & 7) & 1;
#else
    uint8_t result = (s->buffer[(index - 1) >> 3] << ((index - 1) & 7)) >> (8 - 1);
#endif

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (index <= s->size_in_bits_plus8){
        return result;
    }
    else{
        s->index--;
        return 0;
    }
#else
    return result;
#endif
}

This version first increments the `s->index` and references it as `index` in the rest of the function. It integrates operations for calculating `result` into one line instead of two separate steps, adding a marginal increase in efficiency. In terms of functionality, it will execute in the identical way as the original code.
Take note though, as presented already, these changes are extremely cosmetic and slight, not carrying any substantial difference from the original implementation, due the restrictions specified.
