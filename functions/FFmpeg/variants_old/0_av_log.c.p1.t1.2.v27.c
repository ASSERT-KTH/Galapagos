It's challenging to significantly alter the behavior of the function without impacting its original functionality since it has a precise goal: structured logging using a variable argument list. Any additional behavior would modify this core functionality. Moreover, making some valid modifications might involve adding some control flow logics, in terms of handling exception actions, etc. If only distinct equal functionality is required the variant can look like this -


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    
    try 
    {
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    } 
    catch(...)
    { 
        // rethrowing the exception
        va_end(vl);
        throw; 
    }

    va_end(vl);
} 
   
Note that provided change (a try-catch block) only modifies function's behavior if some runtime exception occurs. Usually, there's no guarantee about standard implementations of vararg functions throwing exceptions, but here it's used just to illustrate potential ways to adhere to the constraints like no influence on logged message, no usage of auxiliary functions, and no change of output except the central logic of calling av_vlog().
