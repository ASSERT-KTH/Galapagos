Sure, we could do several refactorings, such as moving the calls into conditionals based on the validity of the assumptions or swapping the call order and conditions to safe-guard against unseen situations. However, most of these won't strictly "maintain original functionality". For reliable guarantees, we should ensure the assertions and see the sanctity of tmp and returned value.

One approach can be just rearranging code and creating some extra variables to temper before setting the actual returning one (tmp). It will look bigger and a bit more cluttered though.

static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int preliminary_tmp;
    uint64_t boundary;

    av_assert2(n>0 && n<=25);
    OPEN_READER(pbReader, s);
    UPDATE_CACHE(pbReader, s);
    preliminary_tmp = SHOW_UBITS(pbReader, s, n);
    av_assert2(preliminary_tmp < (boundary = UINT64_C(1) << n));

    // ALL the checks were fulfilled -> affecting tmp
    register unsigned int tmp = preliminary_tmp;  
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(pbReader, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(pbReader, s);

    return tmp; 
}

Please be aware, this programming task would be best given specific context since performance and exact behaviour (what if assertions are false?) matter greatly. Always testing assertions before would be slower but safer, so it really depends on what conditions this code would be running under and what the requirements demand.
