Here's a code variant that reorders and clusters some operations, and incorporates different styles of assignments, but preserves the original functionality:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s) 
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result;

    //Increment s.index to accomplish index++ in original function  
    s->index += 1; 

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = s->buffer[index >> 3];
    result = (result >> (index & 7)) & 1;
#else
    result = s->buffer[index >> 3];
    result = (result << (index & 7)) >> (8 - 1);
#endif    
#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (index < s->size_in_bits_plus8) {
         s->index = index;  
      }
    else{
	       s->index--;
	  }
#endif

    return result;
}

Congratulations! You should now better understand the concept of a reference implementation and how to maintain a function's signature.
