Given the constraints mentioned, it is challenging to significantly change the behavior of the implementation without breaking its functionality. The function is simply an intermediary parser for the variadic arguments passing it to av_vlog function. Functionality fundamentally depends on the behavior of av_vlog. However, Logging decision can be added as a program variant :

#include <stdarg.h>

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    if(level > 0) {
        va_list vl;
        va_start(vl, fmt);
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
        va_end(vl);
    }
}

With the variant changed, the function will only invoke `av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);` if `level` is more than 0. Please note that significance of log level values (like debbug logging, Info logging etc.) needs to be defined based on your application's requirements. Minor levels (value <= 0) might be considered less important and hence not logged. This is a common behavior in Log level settings in multiple tools (Log4J for instance).
