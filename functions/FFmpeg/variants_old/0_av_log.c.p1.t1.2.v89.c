The variant function can be created by adding checks for the level and avcl variables. For instance, let's introduce an error handling - if level of logging is above some pre-defined allowed level or if no device context is provided (`avcl` is null), the function can refuse to log the message. Of course, this will not strictly keep the original behaviour, but adding a couple of error checks seems to be reasonable without changing its core functionality.


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    if(level > MAX_ALLOWED_LEVEL || avcl == NULL)
        return;

    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
}


This variant of the av_log function halted itself if the function is called without the avcl being defined or log level is above allowances, thereby it doesn't try to pass these values to av_vlog function.
Remember to define `MAX_ALLOWED_LEVEL` for this to work properly.

Note, these each in-loss checks are merely an example of how you can modify the function's behaviour without fundamentally changing it, or breaking the program flow outside of this av_log function scope.
