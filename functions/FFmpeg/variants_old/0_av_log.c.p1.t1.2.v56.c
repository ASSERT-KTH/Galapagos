The following variant slightly modifies the original function behavior by adding extra logging logic to print debug messages when the log level is equal to or higher than a specific value (like 99 in the given example).

You will see that two printf expression are added, that help to log beginning and ending of each `av_log` invocation with level 99 or more. Otherwise, function behaves exactly as original.


#include <stdarg.h>

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    
    // Additional Debug logic added
    if(level >= 99)
    {
        printf("DEBUG BEGIN: Level 99 or greater log entry started\n");
    }
    
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
    
    // Additional Debug logic added
    if(level >= 99)
    {
        printf("DEBUG END: Level 99 or greater log entry ended\n");
    }
}

Please note that this added functionality is just an example; depending on your requirements, this added logic could be for many other purposes. Be sure to include the necessary header file for the functions printf such as `#include <stdio.h>` in case it's not included elsewhere in your program.
