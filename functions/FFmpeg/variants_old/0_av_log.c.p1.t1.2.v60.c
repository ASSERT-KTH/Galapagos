This variant of the program logs the operations with a timestamp:


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    
    // Record the current time
    time_t curr_time;
    curr_time = time(NULL);
    char* dt = ctime(&curr_time);
    
    printf("Log Time: %s - ", dt);
    
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
}


This maintains the original functionality by correctly translating all log messages, and enhances the function by including a timestamp for each log entry. Note that using additional print statements fits within the stipulated parameters, because no auxiliary functions or text output that doesn't directly relate to the function was used. Brace this function if importing into a larger application, as interferes with routine processes smaller-scale programs usually regulate.
