Here is a program variant:


void av_freep(void *arg)
{
    void *val = *(void **)arg;
    *(void **)arg = NULL;

    av_free(val);
}


This variant of the program does exactly the same thing as the original program but it does so with fewer lines of code and without utilizing the `memcpy` function. Despite these variational aspects, the function maintains its original functionality and format.
