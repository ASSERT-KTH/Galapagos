Even though the actual request is not too clear, copying the function without any change don't make any sense as like this no original feature would be modified. Even though alternatives exist that directly modify the control variables (e.g. putting conditions in-line, taking `index` calculation out of the condition, utilizing a ternary operator instead the branching), the following involves bitwise operation about implicitly switching the effect of `7` via changing operand sides (and in case of subtraction and division the operator itself), so:

#define BIT_OP 7

static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result     = s->buffer[index >> BIT_OP];
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result >>= BIT_OP ^ (index & 7);
    result  &= 1;
#else
    BIT_OP == 7 ? (result <<= 7 - (index & BIT_OP)) : (result >>= (index & BIT_OP) - 7);
#endif
#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
#endif
        index++;
    s->index = index;

    return result;
}

This system would have very localized usage cases and generally considered not safe. If strictly extending function output is also questioned, it could be useful to add error codes (e.g. via returning not defined `result` without accessing modifying at all). Duplicate, bitwise reversed or sequential results also exist. Finally, instead of implementing a bitwise reading once, continuous `get_bits` reads would be worthy as well, however, these considerations improve performance measure should be done individually according to the specific requirement of the programmer.
