Here is a modified variation of your provided function:


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n)
{
    int shift;
    for(; n > 0; n--){
        shift = 7 - s->bit_index;
        if (shift < 0) 
        {
            s->bit_index = (*s->buf == 0xff) ? 0 : s->bit_index;
            if(s->bit_index == 0){
                *(++s->buf) = 0;
            }
            shift = 7;
        }

        *s->buf |= val << shift;
        s->bit_index++;
    }
}


In the original function, the bits are handled in a stepwise fashion, verified and packed after each bit check. In the provided variant, shifting is approached as an equivalent number computation within an `if` block that will "wrap around", when the bit index has reached the count of 8. But, in practice this variant mainlychanges the logical approach, as in many cases the performance will not differ from the initial code listing.
