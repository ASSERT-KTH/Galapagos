You can include an optional debugging mechanism that logs when and what memory is being freed. This can greatly help during debugging service and might help detect memory leak sources or heap corruption.


void av_free(void *ptr)
{
#if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
    printf("Debug: Freeing aligned memory at %p\n", ptr);
    _aligned_free(ptr);
#else
    printf("Debug: Freeing memory at %p\n", ptr);
    free(ptr);
#endif
}


In this modified function, the basic functionality remains the same but the behavior is slightly altered, with the function now additionally providing debug output whenever it's called. This can make it easier to track memory management and help detect eventual issues like leaks etc. 

Please note including <stdio.h> might be necessary if not already present in the original file and using print statements is acceptable for the debug purpose. Also, keep in mind that use of printf is illustrative. In production code, logging function or log streaming is more suitable such as use of syslog in Linux.
