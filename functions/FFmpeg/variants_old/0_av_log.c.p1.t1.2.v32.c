Here is the program variant that changes the behaviour by adding a conditional statement to exhibit additional functionality only if the level is below a certain threshold, while it still maintains the original functionality.


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    
    if(level < 10) {
        printf("Debug: Level is less than 10.");
    }
    
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
}

Please, note that while we are adding conditional statement here for demonstration purposes â€“this example simply prints out an additional debug statement only when the level is below 10. Therefore this change can be easily extended or modified to support more meaningful changes and custom condition-based behaviours as per the requirements.

Also, in an enterprise-level, production codebase we should address that this code introduces a possible side-effect i.e. it may not compile in an environment where `printf` is forbidden or redirecting the `stdout` would have side effects. These should be addressed in more comprehensive code-revision and adequate error handling/testing strategies should be incorporated based on specific software requirements.
