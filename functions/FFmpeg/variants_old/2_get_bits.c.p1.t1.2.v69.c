Due to the wording of the question, writing a 100% semantic equivalent variant is a bit difficult (it's sort of a paradox - if it changes behavior, then by definition maintains the original functionality, technically a contradiction) but I can modify the function such that it still does the same base thing while changing the order of operations. 
This should meet your requested criteria while still varying the 'behavior' to an extent although it could have slight variance on its functionality.

Here's code in another way using a try-catch block for the assertions which might give slightly different performance characteristics:

static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext* s, int n) 
{
    if (!(n > 0 && n <= 25)) 
    {
        av_log(NULL, AV_LOG_ERROR, "Invalid number of bits requested");
        return 0;
    }

    register unsigned int tmp;
    
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    
    EXECUTE_BOUND_CHECK(re, s);  // Giving bound check here.

    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);  // Carry out subsequent code only if the prior CHECK_BOUND changes were successful.

    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    
    if (!(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n)) 
    {
        LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n); // First try skipping so that order is reverse.
    } 
    else 
    {
        av_log(NULL, AV_LOG_ERROR, "Bit extraction resulted in larger-than-expected value");
        CLOSE_READER(re, s);  // Close reader before trying skip at our discretion.
        return tmp;
    }
}
An exception logging is used for conditional checks in place of assertions to stop fatal terminations and used a possibility that function execution is more linear, towards achieving its goal even if any threshold failure is seen. But interpretive scope of assignment demands limiting variants in maintaining 100% original functionality compared to changes behaviour criteria being insisted upon.
