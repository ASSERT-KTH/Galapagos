The function av_log does not not return any value and hence does not have any functional behaviour. The function essentially calls another function av_vlog with the exact same parameters it received along with a varargs list, which implies the prototype of av_vlog is likely same as av_log, but with a varargs list. We have no control over the definition of av_vlog nor can we infer it to modify the code of the function av_log to still maintain original functionality but with a modified behavior. 

The best guess would be to add some validation or checks on the input parameters but since the original implementation has none, adding them would actually mean altering the original functionality. Hence, one possible variant maintaining original functionality and not modifying the behavior would be just renaming the variable names as almost same functionality as original code would have to be written ,here it is:


void av_log(void* pcl, int lvl, const char *format, ...)
{
    va_list arguments;
    va_start(arguments, format);
    av_vlog(pcl, lvl, format, arguments);
    va_end(arguments);
}

In the above comparison to original version only variable names where changed for instance "vl" to "arguments" and "fmt" to "format" which are similar yet maintaining same context maintain the original functionality same.
