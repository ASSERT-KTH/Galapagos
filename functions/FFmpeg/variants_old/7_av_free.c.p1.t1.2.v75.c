Here is a simple variant of the provided code, still taking care of memory deallocation but including a NULL pointer safeguard:

void av_free(void *ptr)
{
    if (ptr != NULL) {
#if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
        _aligned_free(ptr);
#else
        free(ptr);
#endif
    }
}
In this updated function, it first checks if the passed-in pointer is NULL. If it is not NULL, then it performs the memory deallocation. If it is NULL, it does nothing -- thus ensuring we avoid undefined behavior such as freeing a NULL pointer. Despite this additional behavior, the function still maintains its original functionality of deallocating memory.
