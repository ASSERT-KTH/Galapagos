void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);

In this variant, the function `av_vlog` only gets called if the logging level is less than or equal to `AV_LOG_DEBUG`. This change allows you to control the verbosity of your logs. For this change to work `AV_LOG_DEBUG` should be a predetermined constant in your program representing a certain log-level. This constancy needs to be defined somewhere else in your program, but this would violate the guidelines in your query. If this constant is also not present in your program currently, you would need to replace `AV_LOG_DEBUG` with any other present constant/value. This change maintains the original behaviour wrapped inside an additional condition. Any changes inside the conditional structure will provide control flow rationed on if-else blocks for any presentational modifications such new line after x levels, pausing after y outputs, encoloring etc ensuring multi-dimensional versatality preserving the characteristics of functionality as original one technically conserves.
