In order to maintain the original functionality while changing behavior, an additional condition or logic should be added which does not impact the core function's processing. In the variation below, we've added a check for checking whether "fmt" argument is NULL or not. Although ideally, user should never pass formate string as NULL, it's still a good idea to have this check for enhanced saferty:


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    if (fmt != NULL)
    {
        va_list vl;
        va_start(vl, fmt);
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
        va_end(vl);
    }
}


Notice that if fmt is NULL, nothing happens; this changes the behaviour of the function compared to the reference implementation which doesn't contain NULL checking. If in the reference implementation, fmt is NULL, uncertain behavior will likely occur. The new implementation thus prevents this uncertain behaviour while maintaining the original functionality when fmt is not NULL.
