Here is a variant that maintains the behavior and functionality of the given function.


static int get_bits(Jpeg2000DecoderContext *s, int n)
{
    int res = 0;
    bool is_not_null_byte = false;

    do {
        res <<= 1;

        if (s->bit_index == 0) {
            is_not_null_byte = bytestream2_get_byte(&s->g) != 0xFF;
            s->bit_index = 7 + is_not_null_byte;
        }

        --s->bit_index;
        res |= (bytestream2_peek_byte(&s->g) >> s->bit_index) & 1;

    } while (--n > 0);
    
    return res;
}

Some refactoring has been performed for easier comprehension:

- The `while` loop has been converted into a `do-while` loop to always ensure the loop's body is executed at least once, but `n` is validated just as before.
- We now have `--s->bit_index`; in the original code, decrement operator written after ensures that operation is executed last; in the new code, operation is executed first.
- Use a local variable `is_not_null_byte` to temporarily hold the boolean value of the expression, thus use `is_not_null_byte` directly in update assignment of `s->bit_index`.
  Adding temporary/clearly named variables can accordingly improve the readability/maintainability of your code. Refactoring was accentuated for better code understanding.
  
Note: The most important is putting `--n > 0` condition in `do-while` loop has same functionality as `--n >= 0` condition in `while` loop. Since `do-while` loop always runs at least once, `n` can be decremented one time before the condition check. Thatâ€™s why it checks for `--n > 0` (n is decremented before the condition is tested).  
                                           
Just ensure to dereference pointer to make sure that you're actually calling a reference function, as the method was intended to be called by reference - assuming `bytestream2_get_byte(&s->g) ` and `bytestream2_peek_byte(&s->g)` manage exceptions, errors or specific conditions internally and handle `NULL` pointers. Check if stream handlers correctly manage exceptions and do not let approach involving reference calling somehow manhandled, as there is an assumption those functions correctly handle 'misbehaviour'.
