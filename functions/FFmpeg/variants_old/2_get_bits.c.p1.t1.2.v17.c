Here's the requested alternative approach that maintains the function's signature and functionality:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp;

    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    if (!(n>0 && n<=25)) {
        printf("%s", "Violation: n is not within the admissible 1..25 range");
        exit(1);
    }

    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    
    if (!(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n)) {
        printf("%s", "Violation: tmp is bigger than the upper allowed limit");
        exit(2);
    }

    return tmp;
}

This variant changes the behaviour by introducing human-readable error messages and early termination (exiting the program) instead of using assertions - when these validations fail. If multiple crashes appear during execution, these changes would provide clearer feedback to make debugging easier. Apart from that, the initial functionality is preserved - making the validation checks backward-safe. The validations/checks are stricter - failing if both the lower and upper limits and not net on a fatal "assertions-style" manner, which is the primary change initiated in the writing style. This solution remained within the constraints specified.
