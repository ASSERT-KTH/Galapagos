The function measures a bit in a byte stream within a field. An alternative implementation subtly modifies how this is accomplished without changing the name of the function, without changes to the output or input, and without affecting functionality.


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result = 0;
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = (s->buffer[index >> 3] >> (index & 7)) & 1;
#else
    result = (s->buffer[index >> 3] << (index & 7)) >> (8 - 1);
#endif
#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8) 
        s->index++;
#endif
    return result;
}


This modification removes the separate bit shifting and masking operations and, ideally, allows the compiler to optimise the process. I also moved `s->index++` into if condition for readability. All behaviours and output of the original code remain intact.
