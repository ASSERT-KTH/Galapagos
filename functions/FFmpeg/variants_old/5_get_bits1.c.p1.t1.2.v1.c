In the above variant of the original function, it is still achieving the same functionality but with slightly changed behavior. Instead of will directly perform bitwise 'AND' operations on 'index' value, new variables 'offset' and 'condition' are introduced to make the code cleaner, understandable, and debug friendly. This guarantees same results due to precedence of bitwise operations taking effect from right to left in same precedence operations.
