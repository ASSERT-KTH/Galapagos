The following variant of the specified function includes a case handling structure, that can be modified to change the behavior of the function without affecting its original functionality.


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    switch(level) {
        case 1: 
            //Insert changed behavior for level 1
            av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
            break;
        case 2:
            //Insert changed behavior for level 2
            av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
            break;
        default:
            av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
            break;
    }
    va_end(vl);
}

Now, depending on the "level" parameter passed into the function, we can modify its behavior while its original functionality remains intact for the default case. This particular type of variant won't upset the existing calling code but allows for future enhancement or customization according to the distinct level values.
