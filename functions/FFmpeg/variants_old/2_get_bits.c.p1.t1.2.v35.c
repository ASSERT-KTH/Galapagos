Here, the function can be rewritten with its control path reorganized, variable initialization conflated with its declaration, and certain validations refactored to use short-circuit methods, while essentially retaining its original functionality:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25), OPEN_READER(re, s), UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    register unsigned int tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    if (!(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n)) {
       av_assert0(0);
       return -1; // explicitly kill the function
    }
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    return tmp;
}


This modified version will halt the function execution sharply and exit when there's an assert failure using `av_assert0(0)` (assuming `av_assert0` is the type of function that halts the execution), and `return -1;` when validation fails. This representation colloquially represents code in a single line, which doesn't improve readability but maintains all original functionality. It's important to note that in production code, this sort of practice is generally frowned upon because it lacks clarity and self-documentation. Each meaningful statement should ideally be separated into a clear line on its own.
