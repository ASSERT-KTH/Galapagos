Sure, see this program variant:


void *av_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size)
{
    size_t result = nmemb * size;  

    // Handle overflow
    if (nmemb != 0 && result / nmemb != size) {
        return NULL;
    }

    // Use calloc to allocate memory which also sets memory to 0
    return calloc(nmemb, size);  
}



Note: This version of the function uses the built-in `calloc` function to allocate memory and set it to zero, much like `av_mallocz` does. If memory allocation fails (or there is an integer overflow), `calloc` returns `NULL`, similarly to the original function. Remember to include relevant headers (`stdlib.h` for `calloc`). This version does lack cache alignment and poisoning features found in FFmepgâ€˜s `av_malloc`.

The original function `av_calloc` is a part of FFmpeg's libavutil library. Size of each element and number of such elements required to be allocated is passed as arguments to the function. `av_mallocz()` and `size_mult()` are also functions present in the same library. Since these function are not standard CC, simple multiplication and `calloc()` are used respectively in the re-written function. `Calloc()` also makes sure that the memory is set to 0 as does `av_mallocz()`.
