Here is a function variant that changes the code structure but keeps the original functionality contained within this function.


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result;
#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index >= s->size_in_bits_plus8)
    {
         return result;
    }
#endif
    result = s->buffer[index >> 3];
    
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = (result >> (index & 7)) & 1;
#else
    result  = ((result << (index & 7)) >> (8 - 1));
#endif
    s->index = ++index;
    
    return result;
}


In this variant, an early return is established in the unchecked bitstream reader condition and the calculation of the `result` is streamlined by nesting it in a single operation instead of two independent stepwise operations. Besides these points, the behavior of the function is kept identical to its original function.
