Variant 1:

void av_frame_free(AVFrame **frame)
{
    if (*frame) {
        av_frame_unref(*frame);
    }

    av_freep(frame);
}

Here, within logic, it always releases allocated memory by calling av_freep(frame), unlike the original function. Even if the passed frame is null, it goes on to release it, irrespective of its state. This will help clean up potentially wasted memory.

Variant 2:

void av_frame_free(AVFrame **frame) 
{
    if (!frame) return;
    else if (!*frame) return;
    else {
        av_frame_unref(*frame);
        av_freep(frame);
    }
}

Instead of a single-line if clause doing double-bar boolean checking for NULL value assertion, this version unpacks the conditional into separate segments. This may improve understanding from other developers who could find one line condition to be complex.

Variant 3:

void av_frame_free(AVFrame **frame) 
{
    if (frame && *frame) {
       av_frame_unref(*frame);
       av_freep(frame);
    }
}

In this version, we have altered experience of reading the first "if" statement. Changed from a short-circuit operation that checks for NULL, The new expression returns true if frame is not NULL and *frame is not NULL, as opposed to returning on finding true (if frame is NULL or *frame is NULL).
