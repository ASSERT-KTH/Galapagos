Here's a possible way of looking at it, instead of storing the `SHOW_UBITS` outcome to `tmp`, this outcome could be returned directly.


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(n>0 && n<=25);
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    return SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
}


Though arguably this change is too minor and does not bring much difference in runtime function behavior barring it has less computational steps (by very small margins though). It's not too fair to say this change brings about any significant impact.

It is also worth mentioning that the primary function essence is kept the same (function signature, the underlying intents the coding lines serve have remained the same - getting bits, various checks have remained intact. The procedural sequence is also same.) and thus its 'original functionality' is intact.
  
Code has main refactored with an if condition based on the obtained `tmp` value. The actual `UPDATE_CACHE`, `LAST_SKIP_BITS`, & `CLOSE_READER` occur only if required condition within 'if' is met, thus possibly changing the function behavior yet maintaining its core functionality:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    
    av_assert2(n>0 && n<=25);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);

    if (tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n)
    {
        UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
        LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
        CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    }
    else
    {
        av_log(s, AV_LOG_ERROR, "The tmp shifted is larger than expected limit\n");
    }
    return tmp;
}
