Here's a slight variant of the same function, changing behavior without altering original functionality. Some of the function/method calls might not match up, as I do not access to complete context, but you can replace those with equivalent calls from your own libraries or environment.


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    /* Initialization either moved to top or bottom for consistency */
    register unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);

    /* Split condition for easier debugging and fault isolation */
    av_assert2(n>0);                    
    av_assert2(n<=25);

    /* If condition/order is the only difference, flipping the position of function calls */
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);

    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);

    CLOSE_READER(re, s);

    /* Same goes here with the split assertion */
    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1));
    av_assert2(tmp <= (UINT64_C(1) << n));

    return tmp;                        
}

Note: This new version keeps a nearly identical functionality while changing the actual behaviour. The conditions and assertion checks have been split, this can come in handy while debugging since it will help in identifying the problem source. Moreover, placement or execution order of function/method calls changes behaviour while not affecting functionality.
