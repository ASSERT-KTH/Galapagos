Here's one possible refactoring while maintaining functionality. It provides a more early-return style:


void *av_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size)
{
    size_t result;

    if (size_mult(nmemb, size, &result) >= 0)
        return av_mallocz(result);
    
    return NULL;
}


This refactoring follows the same structure but groups the return statement with the if block where it belongs logically. It does not change the functionality or the behavior, because it's just a different presentation of logical equivalence.

Following the same logic, the condition checking with direct use of an `av_mallocz(result)` inside the `if` block does cut a few unnecessary lines without changing the behaviour or integrity of the function. This change adheres to the Don't-Repeat-Yourself (DRY) principle.

As long the this pseudofunction `size_mult(nmemb, size, &result)` always modifies `result` regardless of its return value (which we have to assume because your shared source code relies upon this), we should be safe with the proposed changes.
