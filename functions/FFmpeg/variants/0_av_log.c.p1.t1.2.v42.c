The request asks to provide a different version of the function but to maintain its functionality. One of the changes could be error checking if avcl is null pointer. 


#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    if(avcl == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Passed pointer is NULL.\n");
        return;
    }

    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
}

Although the basic functionality of the function doesn't change, error handling has been added that will abort the function if a null pointer for avcl parameter is provided.
