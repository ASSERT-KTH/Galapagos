The signature of the function suggests that `av_log` is a variable argument function (often identified by the ellipsis) which sends formatted outputs to another function `av_vlog`. 

This code evidently relies heavily on `variadic functions` and libary `stdarg`. Due to this, not many transformable variations are available considering we shouldn't introduce extra structural or auxiliary changes or not call `av_vlog`.

One minor adjustment could be rearranging variable declarations to show different styles of writing.


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...) {
    
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl,fmt); 
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);   
}


And if we are dealing with C99 or newer we could mix declaration on one line, this isn't recommended in real practice.


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...) {

    va_list vl; va_start(vl, fmt); 
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
}
+ 

Another possible transformation, would be what is usually made by formatting tools which is adjusting braces and white-space locations: 


void av_log( void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ... )
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start( vl, fmt );
    av_vlog( avcl, level, fmt, vl );
    va_end( vl );
}


Please note that these transformations do not alter functionality, but simply adjust coding style.
