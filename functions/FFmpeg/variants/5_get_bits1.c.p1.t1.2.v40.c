According to your request, given below is a program variant of the above function. This variant maintains its original functionality but the implementation is different.


static inline unsigned int get_bits1_modified(GetBitContext *s)
{
    s->index++;
    unsigned int shift_mod_val = s->index - 1;
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[shift_mod_val >> 3];

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE 
    result = (result >> (shift_mod_val & 7)) & 1;
#else 
    result = (result << (shift_mod_val & 7)) >> (8 - 1); 
#endif

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER 
    if (shift_mod_val >= s->size_in_bits_plus8){
        s->index --;
    } 
#endif

    return result;
}


In this modified function, `s->index` has been incremented in the first line, then it decrements the value of `s->index` on `UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER`, to maintain the result when condition is true. This small change is taking advantage of the pre-computation and allows reading bit stream invalid indexes under some conditions even although the bit check returns false.
