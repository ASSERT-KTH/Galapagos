Sure, Here's an approach using direct multiplication to calculate 'result' instead of using mult_size function in av_calloc, also adding checks for overflow in multiplication and accordingly return NULL:


#include <stdint.h>
void *av_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size)
{
    if(nmemb && SIZE_MAX/nmemb < size)
        return NULL; 
    size_t result = nmemb * size;
    if(result < nmemb) 
        return NULL;
    else 
        return av_mallocz(result);
}


Here, we first check if 'nmemb' and 'size' on multiplication would cause an overflow. If it does, it would indicate that we are trying to allocate more memory than a size_t can hold(which would lead to undefined behavior), so we'll return NULL. 

Also, there's an another check after the multiplication to see if 'result' is lesser than 'nmemb'. If it is, it again signifies the occurrence of an overflow condition and we return NULL.

If no such overflow case is encountered, we continue ahead with the function as it would have related in the reference implementation.
