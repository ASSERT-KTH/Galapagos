Here's a different version of the mentioned function, maintaining the basic functionality while slightly changing behavior -


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n) {
    register unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    
    // Make use of side-effects in logical AND operation to perform 
    // both assertions in one line instead of two.
    av_assert2((n>0 && n<=25) && ((UPDATE_CACHE(re, s), (tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n), LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n)), 1) && tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n));

    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    return tmp;
}


In the given variant:
- Grouped two `av_assert2` calls into a single call with clever utilization of logic AND operation side-effect, getting rid pulling one `av_assert2` call.
- Used sequence of expressions separated by commas within parentheses to instantiate variable `tmp` and method `LAST_SKIP_BITS` within combined assert.
- Also streamlined the function by inlining methods directly to second `av_assert2`.
- Behavior is nearly similar as original and so with functionality, however way & order code gets evaluated has been improvised.
