The bitwise operations "index >> 3" and "index & 7" were replaced by arithmetic operations "/ 8" and "% 8", respectively, as they give the very same results in those cases.  
Similarly, "result >>= ..." was replaced by "/= ...", "result <<= ..." by "*= ...", etc.
This transformed function maintains the original functionality, just by changing some of the operators.
