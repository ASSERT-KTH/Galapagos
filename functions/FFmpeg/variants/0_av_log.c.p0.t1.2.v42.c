The below transformation avoids forwarding the vargs list (`vl`) when the input level is less than a certain limit (e.g., 5). This could be useful in scenarios where your program is dealing with different logging levels and you don't want to propagate vargs for lower levels. 
It's not an identical behavior, but for most practical uses, it preserves the functionality of the original function.


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    if (level >= 5) {
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    }
    va_end(vl);
}


Here, for `level < 5`, `av_vlog` won't be executed. Instead, `va_end()` will be executed immediately. Note that this transformation requires context to make sense, specifically knowledge of behavior of both `av_vlog` and how different about logging levels are handled. In contexts where lesser logging levels are disregarded, this transformation retains essential functionality.
