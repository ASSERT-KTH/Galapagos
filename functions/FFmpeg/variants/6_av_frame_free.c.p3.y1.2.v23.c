Go does not use pointer-to-pointer (**), so you cannot have a direct translation of the C code that uses **frame. However, you can pass a pointer to a variable of type AVFrame (i.e., *AVFrame) and then return an updated value from the function.

Here's a hypothetical translated opt of this code in Go:

go

import (
	"ffmpeg"
	"github.com/3d0c/gmf"
)

func av_frame_free(frame *gmf.Frame) *gmf.Frame {
    if frame == nil {
        return nil
    }

    frame.Unref()
    gmf.AvFreep(frame)
    
    return frame
}


Please note that C's av*_free management functions can't exactly have a correlation in Go because they are directly tied to how the C programming language does memory allocation & management whereas Go handles memory automatically using garbage collection.
