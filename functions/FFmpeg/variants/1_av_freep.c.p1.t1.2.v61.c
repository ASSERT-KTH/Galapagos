Here's the code variant: This program variant also maintains the original functionality of the function; which is to free memory pointed to by the argument, responsible of maintaining integrity of memory management in program's lifecycle avoiding memory leaks. However, it changes the dynamic way of copying value from argument to manual referencing and dereferencing.


void av_freep(void *arg)
{
    void **ptr_val;
    ptr_val = (void**)arg;

    void *val = *ptr_val;
    *ptr_val = NULL;
    
    av_free(val);
}

This code firstly interpret the passed pointer as a pointer to pointer variable type. Then it stores the value located at the place pointed by arg into val, similarly to the memcpy operation in the original code, but in manual way.
After that it nulls the memory location 'arg' pointed to, again manually without using memcpy, and finally releasing the memory block pointed by val using av_free function as in the original code while maintaining memory integrity.  Remark that it's assumed that 'arg' points to a memory location carrying a void pointer. Otherwise this method would result in undefined behavior. Please verify proper usage based on the environments specifics.
