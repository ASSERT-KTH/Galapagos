Here is the variant of the program. This program still accomplishes the original task with an additional condition checking to ensure that the values passed to the function are positive values as to avoid allocating memory with negative sizes.


void *av_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size)
{
    if (nmemb <= 0 || size <= 0)  // Checking if nmemb or size is less than equal to 0, in such case return NULL
        return NULL;
    
    size_t result;

    if (size_mult(nmemb, size, &result) >= 0)
        return av_mallocz(result);
    else
        return NULL;
}

In this variant, we added an error check at the start just to avoid any possible memory corruption threats or other undefined behaviors due to invalid parameters, considering scenarios where nmemb or size could be a negative value or zero.
Although the original functioning is already fine and well-handled.
