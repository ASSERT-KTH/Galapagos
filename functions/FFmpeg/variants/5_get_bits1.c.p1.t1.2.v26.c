Sure, Here's a slight rewrite of this function while preserving its original functionality.


static inline unsigned int get_bits1_alt(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[index / 8]; // equivalent to shift right by 3

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = result >> (index & 7); // replaced operator shorten to "=".
    result = result & 1; // replacing the "&=" operator with "=" for explicit assignment 
#else
    result = result << (index & 7);
    result = result >> (8 - 1);
#endif

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
        index = index + 1;  // replacing operator ++ with explicit addition
    else 
        index = index;
#endif
    s->index = index;

    return result;
}


In this variant function, I followed the initial logic and essence but with explicit statement versions for operations as opposed to shorthand operators utilized in the original function, to make the process more evident to read and understand.
