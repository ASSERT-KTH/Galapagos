Here is a simple alternation of the code while refusing its basic functionality:

static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result;

    if (index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
    {
        result = s->buffer[index / 8];
    }
    else
    {
        result = 0;
    }
    
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = (result >> (index % 8)) & 1;
#else
    result = (result << (index % 8)) >> 7;
#endif
    
    if (!(s->index >= s->size_in_bits_plus8))
    {
        s->index++;
    }

    return result;
}
How this variant remains equivalent: 

The changes in this variant are mainly made to improve readability and maintain original functionality. The main logic of treating with and shifting result is kept the same but readability is improved by adding parentheses and using the division and mod operations. Also, the checking condition has been negated to maintain original functionality in different setting but easier to understand.
