In this variant, the original functionality is maintained while adding an extra behavior: checking if the passed pointer is `NULL` before attempting to free the memory. This can eliminate potential undefined behavior that may occur when 'free' is called with a `NULL` pointer on certain systems.


void av_free(void *ptr)
{
  if(ptr != NULL) {
#if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
     _aligned_free(ptr);
#else
     free(ptr);
#endif
  } 
}


Note: This code assumes the macros `HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC` and the functions `_aligned_free` and `free` are defined elsewhere in code.
