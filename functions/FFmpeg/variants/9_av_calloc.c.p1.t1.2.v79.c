Here is a modified variant of the above implementation of `av_calloc` function:


#include <stdlib.h>

void *av_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size) 
{
    if (nmemb == 0 || size == 0)
        return NULL;

    size_t result;
 
    result = size * nmemb;

    // checking overflow occurred or not
    if(nmemb != result/size)
        return NULL;

    void *ptr = malloc(result);

    if (ptr)
        memset(ptr, 0, result);   // initializing allocate heap memory with zero
    return ptr;
}

Explanation:
In the given function, two callers generated parameters are 'nmemb' and 'size'. The size of total memory that needs to be allocated on the heap depends on these two values. However, the referred function only calculates the result-size using a function `size_mult(nmemb, size, &result)`, which probably multiplies `nmemb` and `size`, and the eventual termination status of `size_mult()` predicts if the total required allocation will  
be successfully determined or not .

In the modified program the vulnerabilities of large-size calculations are dealt with more thoroughly:- 
The memory allocation request may return a ‘NULL’ pointer value if an overflow occurred and resultant size exceeds either its type or the processes defined limit. To be sure an accurate value is allocated memory, any significant circumstances (either `nmemb` or `size` having the value of 0 ) are monitored and otherwise a validating check (result equals- `result / size == nmemb`)  is followed. In case NULL is received the relevant line precedes it calling a null-return procedure. This alternative version of this function ensures accurate memory allocation investigating properly, stops allocation process immediately when taking NULL value plus verifies an overflow pursuit occurrence in which each returned value will be made null immediately considering it abnormal.  

Lastly, just like its usual action, being equivalent to the defined `calloc` method all allocated bytes has been set zero using `memset()`. Hence, it safeguarded maintaining all necessary functionality in a well-guarded alternatively-verifying manner .
