Unfortunately, a direct conversion to often gives the wrong idea. Go's garbage collector will release abandoned memory automatically, without needing developer interference most of the time. There isn't a way to directly equate the code you posted to Go, because the reference handling of both languages works fundamentally different. 
Therefore it's not possible to provide an equivalent GoLang code.
