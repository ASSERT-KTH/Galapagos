The variant to the given function maintains the original functionality but uses a different syntax approach. In this variant, I used the direct casting and assignments rather than relying on the memory copy.


void av_freep(void **arg)
{
    void *val = *arg;    // Direct assignment rather than memory copy
    *arg = NULL;         // Replacing the memory copy for NULL setting 
    av_free(val);  
}
 

Here it is important to remember that, when passing a pointer to a function in C, and you need to change the "pointing" of the argument itself, you must pass a double pointer, declared as "**". A single pointer will not reflect the change to the argument's "pointing" itself since C function calls use pass-by-value parameter passing.
