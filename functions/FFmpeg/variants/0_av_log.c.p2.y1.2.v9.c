The following transformations slightly vary the behaviour while maintaining the functionality of the program. They "unnest" the va_list creation and end calls from a sequence and make an opportunistic return since the original av_vlog function does not return any result, reducing indirection and function call overhead while initiating the variable argument list only once. It's important to note this code is assuming that av_vlog does not modify the va_list or cause any undetermined behavior that could harm this change.

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    if(fmt == NULL){
        va_end(vl);
        return; 
     }
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
}
