Sure, you can rewrite the function in different ways while maintaining its original functionality.

Here is one possible version of the function:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int result     = s->buffer[s->index >> 3];
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = (result >> (s->index & 7)) & 1;
#else
    result = (result << (s->index & 7)) >> (8 - 1);
#endif
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
        ++s->index;

    return result;
} 

In this version of the function, I decentralized the assignment for some computations and swapped the expression with if else body in a preprocessor directive to make it more sequential. I also incremented `s->index`; directly in the last `if` block. This does not change anything in terms of functionality. It is essentially the same functionality, presented differently.
