This task seems to require understanding of specific Macros and the structure definition. Please note that the macro operations OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS, LAST_SKIP_BITS, CLOSE_READER, and av_assert2 conditions aren't defined visibly. 'GetBitContext' is also not defined in the provided code. So, a direct rewrite or modification would be challenging. 

Below is a mere placeholder modification, assuming the actual functionality is correctly dealt with within those undeclared elements, where I've added the macros and an if condition just to state that the behaviour is needed to be modified, but original functionality should remain intact.


static inline unsigned int get_bits_alt(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
  register unsigned int new_tmp;
  
  OPEN_READER(re, s);
  av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25);
  
  UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
  new_tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);

  if (new_tmp >= UINT64_C(1) << n) {
     new_tmp = UINT64_C(1) << n - 1;
  }

  LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
  CLOSE_READER(re, s);

  return new_tmp;
}


Please note that I also recommend declaring and explaining what 'GetBitContext' is and actually defining those Macros above so anyone can get a grasp of how they need to rewrite or modify Get_Bits in a valid way and actually understand how the functionality that's being abstracted away works. In a well-encapsulated system, these macro operations should encapsulate these complex actions into simpler and easier-to-understand modules.
