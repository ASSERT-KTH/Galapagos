Here is one possible variant of the original function:


void av_freep(void **arg)
{
    if(arg){
        void *val = *arg;
        *arg = NULL;
        av_free(val);
    }
}


This variant simplifies the original function by directly assigning the dereferenced value of `arg` to `val`, setting `*arg` to null, and then passing `val` to `av_free()`. It still frees the memory pointed to by the pointer stored at `arg` and then sets `arg` to `NULL`, effectively maintaining the same functionality as the original implementation.
