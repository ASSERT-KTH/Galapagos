Here is a changed version of your code. Logic is the same but operations change a bit.


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    unsigned int tmp;
    if (n > 0 && n <= 25)
    {
        OPEN_READER(re, s);

        UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
        
        tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
        
        if(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n)
        {
            LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
        }
        
        CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    }
    else
    {
        tmp = 0;  // Returning zero for “out of range” bits requested
    }

    return tmp;
}


In this modified version, better structured logic flow implemented via precise `if` conditions first checking whether requested bit number `n` is hard boundaries of '0 < n <= 25' before running the logic inside the function. Bit shift check (`tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n`) also moved up forward before running the `LAST_SKIP_BITS` macro. If `n` is not meeting the prerequisites now we returning `0` instead of fails downward to some critical part of the code rather than dealing with a direct assertion using `av_assert2`.
