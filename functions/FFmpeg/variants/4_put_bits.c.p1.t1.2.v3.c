An alternative approach to implementing the put_bits function is to use bit-wise shifts and merges to form the new output. Still, we adhere to all of the original functions constraints.

Here is one way to rewrite the reference implementation while preserving the original functionality:


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) 
{
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        //if bit buffer is full, ready to be written
        if (s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            s->bit_index = *s->buf == 0xff ? 1 : 0;
            *(++s->buf) = 0;
        }
        // Bit-wise OR with bit buffer after having the desired
        // value bit-shifted to the right position and masked by desired n.
        *s->buf |= (val & 1 << (n - 1 - i)) << (7 - n + 1 + i);

        s->bit_index++;
    }
}


In this code, we still process the bits one by one, maintaining the original functionality. However, the changes here use the 'for' loop instead of the 'while' plus '--' operand to count working bits, which might give a clarity scenario on how many cycles the for loop will go through. Also, bit manipulation handles val rather instead simple OR assignment.
