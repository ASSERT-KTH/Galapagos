Go programming language doesn't support preprocessor directives and there is no standard functionality for aligned allocation and deallocation like in some C standard libraries.

In Go, the garbage collector takes care of memory management itself most of the time. Though Go does have a built-in "unsafe" package intended for cases where Go's own memory management isn't enough for your needs, this is rarely required and often discouraged. As such, the exact behavior of this C code could not be fully replicated in pure Go.

The Go version of this `av_free` function would simply be omitted, because explicit freeing of variables isn't generally necessary in idiomatic Go code.

However if you really want a boilerplate example for the corresponding Go function, here is one. But remember that dealing with pointers directly and without proper precautions in Go lang can be unsafe and prone to runtime errors:

go
// compile time flag
var HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC = false

func av_free(ptr unsafe.Pointer) {
    if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC {
        // implements your logic if you have a logic for aligned allocation
    } else {
        // do nothing as garbage collector clears when no reference left
    }
}


This function doesn't actually frees the memory since Go handles it when no references to it, but meets your requirements about function signature semantically equivalent.
   
Again, it's worth emphasizing that directly freeing memory in Go is discouraged and not idiomatic. Go's garbage collector abstracts these details away, meaning you don't have to free memory manually as you do in languages like C.
