Here's a variant of the given function. This variant maintains its functionality but distributes it differently.


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) 
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
    {
        if (s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            s->bit_index = 0;
            if (*s->buf == 0xff)
            {
               s->bit_index = 1;
            }
            *(++s->buf) = 0;
        }
        *s->buf |= (val & (1<<(n-i-1))) << (7 - s->bit_index);
        s->bit_index++;
    }
}


This version reorganises the `while` loop into a `for` loop and also adjusts the way `val` is shifted onto `*s->buf`. Whereas the original function shifts `val` as a whole for each round of encoding, the revised variant masks `val` with corresponding bit and shifts that bit onto `*s->buf`. This doesn't alter the final encoded result but breaks down the encoding per bit over each separate iteration of the loop.
