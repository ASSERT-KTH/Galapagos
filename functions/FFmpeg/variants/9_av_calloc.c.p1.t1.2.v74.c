Sure, here is the same program with a slightly different approach, it first checks if both variables nmemb and size are greater than zero. If not, it stops execution and returns NULL (preventing the possible multiplication of zeroes and wastage of memory allocations). Still the changes don't affect how the function operates, the functionality remains the same (operate only for valid non-zero size inputs), and it prevents memory wastage.


void *av_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size)
{
    size_t result;

    if (nmemb == 0 || size == 0) 
        return NULL;
  
    if (size_mult(nmemb, size, &result) < 0)
        return NULL;
  
    return av_mallocz(result);
}
