The program variant could incorporate logging the freeing action without affecting the original functionality of the function. This would be done using a simple printf statement to log that `av_free()` has been used.


#include <stdio.h>

void av_free(void *ptr)
{
    printf("av_free() has been used.\n");

#if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
    _aligned_free(ptr);
#else
    free(ptr);
#endif
}
