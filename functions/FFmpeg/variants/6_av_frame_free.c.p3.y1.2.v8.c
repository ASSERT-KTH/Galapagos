In Go, memory is handled differently than in C. Hence, it is not necessary or even possible to directly free memory because pointers are handled through garbage collection.

Here is a mock code. Actual code would depend on libraries being used. Av_freep used in c code suggests using FFmpeg, but a Go equivalent for this library is not directly available,

go
func AvFrameFree(frame **AVFrame) {
	if frame == nil || *frame == nil {
		return
	}

	err := (*frame).Unref()
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("Failed to unref frame:", err)
	}

	*frame = nil
}

Note that `(*frame).Unref` and checking it's returned value assumes that AvFrame implemented an Unref function that returns an error on failure. As Go is garbage collected, setting the frame pointer value to `nil` visually does the same thing as `av_freep(frame)`;, it dereferences the AvFrame pointer so garbage collector can know this memory can be reclaimed.
