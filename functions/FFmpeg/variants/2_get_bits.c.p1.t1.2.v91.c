Here is the variant:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp;
    register unsigned int mask;

    OPEN_READER(re, s); 
    av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25);

    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s); 

    mask = (1 << n) - 1; // Generate a bitmask of n length.
    
    // AND operation to extract the desired number of bits.
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n) & mask;

    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);

    CLOSE_READER(re, s); 

    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);

    return tmp;
}

This variant uses the bit mask to ensure that `tmp` has exactly `n` bits after `SHOW_UBITS`, thus presenting another way to make sure the correct number of bits was acquired. The rest of the code should proceed in a similar way as the original function.
