The modified version could keep check if 'n' is positive and lies within the range in a typical 'if' condition. Check whether 'tmp' < UINT64_C(1) << n in an 'if' condition as well:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);

    if ( !(n>0 && n<=25) ) { return 0; }

    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);

    if(tmp >= UINT64_C(1) << n) { return 0; }
   
    return tmp;
}
 

This version maintains the original functionality, but removes the reliance on asserts. If the input parameters 'n' or 'tmp' violates conditions, the function will simply return 0 formally without getting stopped, keeping runtime execution flow smooth and clean. 

Please note 'av_assert2' is more of a debugging feature, the above code is for a production mode variation. For debugging purpose prefer sticking to the original.
