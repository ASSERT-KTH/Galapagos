Here is a variant of the program that behaves differently. This version uses a ternary operator and directly assigns the result of the operations for normative readability:

static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result     = s->buffer[index >> 3];

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result  = (result >> (index & 7)) & 1;
#else
    result  = (result << (index & 7)) >> (8 - 1);
#endif

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    index   = (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8) ? index + 1 : index;
#else
    index++;
#endif
    s->index = index;
    
    return result;
}

The changes are done keeping in the original functionality intact. Instead of performing the operations on the `result` separately, they are performed concurrently and assigned to `result`. Rather than increment `index` and then assign to `s->index` like the original function, this version conducts the increment simultaneously in the ternary operation (checking `UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER`), improving the code's efficiency in terms of variable assignments.
