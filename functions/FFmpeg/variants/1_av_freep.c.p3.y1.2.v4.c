The `av_freep` function design in C cannot be semantically migrated to Go as it is. The main reason for this is that Go does not have identical concepts of pointers and free memory management as the cases of C language. Also, it should be known that in Go, garbage collection happens automatically and there's no direct replacement for the `av_free` or `free` other direct memory management functions.

But if there is a need of resetting the value at the pointer to its zero equivalent. I have written how it would look like:

go
func avFreep(arg interface{}) {
    var val interface{}

    val = arg
    arg = nil 

    // Deallocating memory using C's free method via Cgo (Depends upon where av_free is implemented)
    c_freep := C.CString(fmt.Sprintf("%v", val))
    C.av_freep(unsafe.Pointer(unsafe.Pointer(&c_freep)))
    C.free(unsafe.Pointer(c_freep))   
}

Adding to the fact that in Go, `nil` is used instead of `NULL` in C.

*NOTE:* For compiling the above go code you are supposed to import `"fmt"` , `unsafe` and `C` at first. Since we mentioned not to implement helper function. The proper way would require the helper function definition at the starting. E.g for C Using `import "C"`*/
