Here is a variant of the function that maintains its original functionality. In this revised version, it runs an initial check to make sure neither `nmemb` nor `size` equals zero before multiplication, which gives extra protection but does not change the overall function behavior:


void *av_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size) 
{
    size_t result;
    if (nmemb == 0 || size == 0) 
    {
        return NULL;
    }

    if (size_mult(nmemb, size, &result) < 0)
    {
        return NULL;
    }

    return av_mallocz(result);
}


In this version, if `nmemb` or `size` is zero the function will return NULL before invoking `size_mult()`. This change could improve performance in scenarios where `size` or `nmemb` could be needlessly passed into `size_mult()`. The functionality and signature of `av_calloc()` remain the same as in the original version.
