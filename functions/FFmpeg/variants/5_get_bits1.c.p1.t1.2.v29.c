Here's a variation of the code which changes the original function's behavior slightly but maintains its main functionality. Most changes revolve around tweaking the way the 'result' variable is handled, as well as replacing some of the bitwise operations to achieve the same outcome but with a altered process:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t intermediateResult = s->buffer[index >> 3];
    uint8_t result;
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = (intermediateResult >> (index & 7)) & 1;
#else
    result = ((intermediateResult << (index & 7)) >> (8 - 1)) & 1;
#endif
#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    index += (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8) ? 1 : 0;
#else
    ++index;
#endif
    s->index = index;

    return result;
}

In this version:
- The computation for the `result` variable in both `ifdef` sections has been compacted into a single statement.
- An `intermediateResult` variable is added to help re-calculation overhead in the `ifdef` sections.
- A conditional increment of `index` replaces the standard increment statement, depending on the state of `s->index` and `s->size_in_bits_plus8`.
  
This variation maintains the same functionality as the initial function but approaches the sequencing of computations quite differently.
