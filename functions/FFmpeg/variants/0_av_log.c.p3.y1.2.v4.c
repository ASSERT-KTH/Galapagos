The C function `av_log` uses variable arguments, which is not supported in Go directly. We can facilitate this by leveraging interfaces. Additionally, the `av_vlog` function is not represented in this context, thus causing difficulty understanding the exact functionality, though a common use case is designed as a utility log function.
   
Please see the following probable wrapper approach in Go:

go
import (
    "log"
    "fmt"
)

func avLog(avcl interface{}, level int, fmt string, v...interface{}) {
	s := fmt.Sprintf(fmt, v...)
	switch level {
	case 1:
		log.Println("[LOW]", avcl, s)
	case 2:
		log.Println("[MID]", avcl, s)
	case 3:
		log.Println("[HIGH]", avcl, s)
	default:
		log.Println("[UNKNOWN]", avcl, s)
	}
}


Here we consider the `level` as a nominal log level indication for demonstration. The `avcl` parameter usage will hinge upon its original implementation.

Please note that this is a suggested Go version considering available C functions. Because the `av_vlog` function exists as part of a bigger library (possibly the FFmpeg library) in C, we need to translate not only the method but also potentially the whole handling library to Go.
