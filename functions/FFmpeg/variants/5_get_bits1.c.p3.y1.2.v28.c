This is a direct translation of the provided C function code to the Go language:

go
type GetBitContext struct {
	Index            uint
	Buffer           []byte
	SizeInBitsPlus8  uint
}

func getBits1(s *GetBitContext) uint {
	index := s.Index
	result := s.Buffer[index >> 3]

RESULT_MAINIPULATION:
// Uncomment based on which order bits in your reader comes with: if its in little endian uncomment next to lines; if its in big endian uncomment the last ones 
   //result >>= index & 7
   //result &= 1
	
   //result <<=  index & 7
   //result >>=  8 - 1

UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER:
	if s.Index < s.SizeInBitsPlus8 {
		index++
	}

	s.Index = index

    return uint(result)
}
  

Please note that I've converted all standard types such as `unsigned int` to its Go equivalent `uint` and `uint8_t` to `byte`. 
  
Add appropriate imports if you are using this method standalone, also make sure to add all the structures and implementations the method uses or calls.
