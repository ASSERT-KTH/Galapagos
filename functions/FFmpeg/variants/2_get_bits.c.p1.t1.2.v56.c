You asked for a variant of your function while maintaining its original functionality. Your function relies on many macro and a struct, which I don't know. Therefore, I just slightly changed re to receive letter r instead.

It should also be mentioned that it assumes the use of macros you provided in the input like OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS, LAST_SKIP_BITS and CLOSE_READER are declared properly.

Here's the modified version of your function:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int result;
    OPEN_READER(r, s);
    av_assert2(n>0 && n<=25);
    UPDATE_CACHE(r, s);
    result = SHOW_UBITS(r, s, n);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(r, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(r, s);
    av_assert2(result < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    return result;
}


This variant merely refactors your source code and shows an alternative approach. The fundamental behavior doesn't change, as I replaced "tmp" and "re" with "result" and "r".
