In regards to keeping identical functionality while modifying internals, look at replacing the preprocessor sections into bitwise manipulations, also, the index can be incremented inline. Complying with the rationale from the prior code, information pertaining to endianness or checking of index can still be fetched via variables.


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int result;
    unsigned int is_little_endian = 1; //replace with a function checking endianness if available.
    unsigned int checked_bitstream_reader = 1; //replace if a function checking this exists.

    result = s->buffer[s->index >> 3];

    if (is_little_endian) {
        result >>= s->index & 7;
        result  &= 1;
    } else {
        result <<= s->index & 7;
        result >>= 8 - 1;
    }

    if (checked_bitstream_reader) {
        if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8) {
            s->index++;
         } else {
            // Handle index error exception.
         }
    } else {
        s->index++;
    }

    return result;
}

This code maintains the initial functionality but undergoes some transformation. It supplies the ability to dynamically switch the behavior between compile-time and runtime. Though within this context dummy variables have been implemented, accordingly, the code must be adjusted based on system particulars.
