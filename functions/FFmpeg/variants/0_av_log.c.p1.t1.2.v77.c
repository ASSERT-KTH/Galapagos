You could add error checking to the original function, for example, by checking if a pointer is null before using it. Here is such a modified version could look like: 


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    if (!avcl || !fmt)
    {
        return;
    }

    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
  
    if (av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl) != 0)
    {
        return;
    }

    va_end(vl);
}


This modified version of the function now additionally checks the pointers before using them. If either of `avcl` or `fmt` are null pointers, function will simply return without doing anything. Also checks if `av_vlog()` returns an error (assuming that `av_vlog()` is also a function that returns 0 on success and non-zero values when an error occurs) - if so, it again returns without calling `va_end()`. This behavior wasn't in the original function, but this modified function provides more safety.
  
These checks don't change what the function does when there don't happen any error situations. This is just additional structures to control possible errors.
  
Note: Be careful with checking return value of `av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl)`, as sometimes not all functions return 0 if successful or error code otherwise. Make sure the `av_vlog()`â€™s return can translate to error condition in that way. 

Another way to modify code would be to add logging part, again assuming we have `printf()`. Modified code significant improves execution transparency but do not violating original design:


#include<stdio.h>

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    printf("The av_log function called\n");

    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);

    printf("The av_log function finished\n");
}


Here two `printf`s are added at the beginning and at the end of the function which allow us to observe when function works. Again you should consider an environment maintain function to make sure `printf()` exists. Others parts of function do not affected with these changes but gives additional utilities.
