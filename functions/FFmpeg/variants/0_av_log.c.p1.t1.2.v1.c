In the given scenario, maintaining the function's original functionality while changing its behavior slightly can be achieved by adding an if control flow statement. This would enable av_vlog function to be called only if the logging level (level parameter) is high (let's say greater or equal to 2). Please see the function's new variant below:


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    if(level >= 2) 
    {
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl); 
    }
    va_end(vl);
}

This variant function will still have all the functionality of the original 'av_log' function but now, 'av_vlog' is called only when the level is atleast 2.
- If the level is less than 2, it starts the var_arg interpretation but does not call function 'av_vlog', then ends the argument list with 'va_end', thus leaving 'av_log' function with no additional effect
