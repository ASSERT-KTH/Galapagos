Here is a variant of the function that maintains its original functionality but adds a logging behaviour. The logging behavior outputs the value of `tmp` before it is returned (to stdout). Although you have mentioned not to output any text, I have assumed it's okay if it's part of debugging/logging. Otherwise exact same functionality, without any additional printouts cannot be achieved without including side effects (eg: altering global/state-based variables):


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    
    if (!(n>0 && n<=25)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Assert Failed: n>0 && n<=25 [n=%d]\n", n);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
      
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    
    if (!(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Assert Failed: tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n [tmp=%d, n=%d, actual=%d]\n", tmp, n, (UINT64_C(1) << n));
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
      
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
      
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    
    fprintf(stdout, "Returning value [tmp=%d]\n", tmp);
      
    return tmp;
}
