1. Change the order of parameters in the av_vlog function call. 

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    av_vlog(level, avcl, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
}

  
2. All lines within a function scope, enclosed within a single conditional statement which always is 'True'. 

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    if (1)
    {
      va_list vl;
      va_start(vl, fmt);
      av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
      va_end(vl);
    }
}

3. Using a do-while loop only once to maintain process seemingly single-threaded. 

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    do {
      va_list vl;
      va_start(vl, fmt);
      av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
      va_end(vl);
    } while (0);
}


Please note: Given that we're talking about 'C' variant transformations - actual syntax for function parameters requires defining strict Type Affinity, differently transforming calls such as to av_vlog() or va_start() could exceed the compliant with merely preserving the original functions “behavior”. To which is, apply varying forms of variable transformation just as long it doesn't break dependencies and exceed its charter to stay within the same operational responsibility. For example adjusting the order of parameters in a function that likely has specific parameter intake order requirements would probably break the code.
