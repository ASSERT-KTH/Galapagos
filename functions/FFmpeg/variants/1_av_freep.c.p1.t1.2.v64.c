Hereâ€™s another variant. This approach maintains the original functionality but changes the behavior by leveraging explicit typecasting instead of memcpy for handling the value assignment.


void av_freep(void **arg)
{
    void *val = *arg; 
    *arg = NULL;
    av_free(val);
}


In this variation, the 'void *' arg has been changed to a pointer to a void pointer ('void **'), enabling pointer-based value manipulation rather than handling memory with memcpy. Pointer *arg here would then always point to NULL after assignment, as the contents of what it pointed to were moved to variable val for work on and won't get changed again as originally was the case, which is comparable to the original functionality of setting the value at the related memory to NULL. This version also simplifies the syntax and reduces function calls (significantly no calls to `memcpy`), potentially enhancing code efficiency based on `av_free()`'s implementation.
