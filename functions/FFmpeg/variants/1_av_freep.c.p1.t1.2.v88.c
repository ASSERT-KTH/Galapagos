Sure, here is one possible variant. It maintains the original functionality of the av_freep() function but organizes the code a bit different with an intermediate cast of the input argument to a pointer to a pointer. This might be a bit more intuitive as the arg argument is actually expected to be a pointer to a pointer.


void av_freep(void *arg)
{
    void **val_ptr = (void **) arg;

    void *val = *val_ptr;
    *val_ptr = NULL;

    av_free(val);
}


In this implementation there's a direct dereference used instead of memcpy to copy the values - this makes the implementation a bit different while not changing the overall action of freeing the memory of the original variable and setting it to NULL. 

This can make the code simpler to trace through as the **val_ptr reference makes it clear that a pointer is being manipulated. However, running code through a static analyzer might raise a flag about the explicit casting in case of usage with wrongly defined data-types.

Proper usage of the function requires to define the function with the next fashion: `av_freep(&pointer_to_be_freed);`.
