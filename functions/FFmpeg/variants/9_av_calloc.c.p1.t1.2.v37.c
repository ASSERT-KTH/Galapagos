Sure, here's the modified version of function. This modification uses a check for the value of nmemb and size. The method maintains the security and overflow check but in a simplified manner:


void *av_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size)
{
    if (nmemb == 0 || size == 0)
    {
        return NULL;
    }
    if ((nmemb * size)/size != nmemb) {
        return NULL;
    }
    return av_mallocz(nmemb * size);
}

This implementation will return NULL not only if the multiplication of `nmemb` and `size` results in overflow but also if either `nmemb` or `size` is zero (which, technically, wouldn't create an overflow, but is most likely an error in some part of the user's code). If all checks pass, the function achieves the desired result by allocating and zeroing `nmemb * size` bytes of memory.
