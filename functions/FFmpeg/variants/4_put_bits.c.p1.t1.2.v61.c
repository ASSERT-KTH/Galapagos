Below is a rewritten function of the initial version where the same functionality is maintained but a different strategy is used for handling the operation i.e., the bitwise shift and update tasks are handled by a temporary holder:


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n)
{
    int remaining_bits;

    for(; n > 0; n--)
    {
        remaining_bits = 8 - s->bit_index;

        if(remaining_bits > n)
        {
            *s->buf |= (val << (remaining_bits - n));
            s->bit_index += n;
        }
        else
        {
            *s->buf |= (val >> (n - remaining_bits));
            s->buf++;
            *s->buf = (*s->buf == 0xff)? *s->buf = 0:0;
            s->bit_index = n - remaining_bits;
            *s->buf = *s->buf | ((val & ((1 << (n - remaining_bits)) - 1)) << (8 - s->bit_index));         
        }
    }
}


This rewritten method considers two central cases. Should the code need to reserve more bits than the current byte in the buffer can handle or need to place the rearranged bits into totality of the next byte and the remaining byte. Take into consideration that this purposefully fulfills the given task, but it is less readable as a result and possibly less efficient.
