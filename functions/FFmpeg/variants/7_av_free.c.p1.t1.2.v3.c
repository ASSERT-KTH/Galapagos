If we want to change the behaviour while keeping the original functionality, one possible approach could be to incorporate logging within the function. This will leave functionality intact but it will record every time the function is used.

Here is an example:


void av_free(void *ptr)
{
  printf("Freeing memory at location: %p\n", ptr);
  
#if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
    _aligned_free(ptr);
    printf("Aligned free operation was executed.\n");
#else
    free(ptr);
    printf("Unaligned free operation was executed.\n");
#endif
}


This edited function now prints to console the address of the memory that is being freed, allowing for debugging or just keeping track of the function usage. It maintains the signature and operation of the original function as requested. 

Please note `printf` is commonly used for printing messages to the console in C projects for testing, debugging, and logging purposes. In production code logging libraries could be more suitable. Check project guidelines for their preference.
