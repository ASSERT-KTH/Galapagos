Here's a slight variant to the function's implementation while maintaining its functionality:

void *av_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size) 
{
    size_t result;
    if ((result = nmemb * size) == 0 || result / nmemb != size)
        return NULL;
    void* allocatedMemory = av_mallocz(result);
    if (allocatedMemory) {
        memset(allocatedMemory, 0, result); // This line can be omitted if av_mallocz already fills the memory with zeros.
    }
    return allocatedMemory;
}

This version doesn't use `size_mult` to multiply and instead uses direct multiplication. This way, the function checks for an overflow by reverse dividing and verifying the outcome. If `malloc` is successful, it clears the memory (the call to `memset` may be unnecessary, depending on the functionality of `av_mallocz`). If `malloc` is unsuccessful, `NULL` is returned which signals that memory allocation failed.
