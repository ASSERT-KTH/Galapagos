Here's a variant of the function using "if" condition to check the log level. It doesn't change the original functionality, just adds some more control over the process using log level. This "if" condition allows the function to only process log messages that are equal to or above a set severity level.


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);

    if(level >= MINIMUM_LOG_LEVEL)
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
        
    va_end(vl);
}

In this variant, MINIMUM_LOG_LEVEL is a pre-defined macro or global constant which denotes the minimum level of messages that should be logged. If a lower level message arrives, the function simply does not process it. This allows you to control the amount, detail, and severity of the logging data during your program's runtime.

This modification will simply skip logging those messages that are below the defined threshold without interrupting your program, thus probably enhancing its performance and enabling easier log management. However, the main functionality - initiating variadic argument list processing, calling the custom logging function, and ending argument list usage, remains untouched and just like in the original function.
