In this somewhat rewritten variant of the function, identical behavior as the original function will still be produced, but various implementation details have changed:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[index >> 3];

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result >>= index % 8;
    result  &= 1U;
#else
    result <<= index % 8;
    result &= 0x80;
    result >>= 7;
#endif
#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
#endif
        s->index = ++index;

    return result;
}


In this rewritten function, the key changes include replacing the binary AND operation `& 7` with the `modulo 8` operator which has the same effect, providing an explicit unsigned suffix to the `1` literal and moving incrementation of `index` to the `s->index` assignment operation.

In spite of these changes, the function will still continue to behave identical to the original function given the same set of inputs.
