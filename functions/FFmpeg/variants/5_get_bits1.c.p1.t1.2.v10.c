Here's a slight modification of the original function with unaltered functionality:

static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    unsigned short get_bit = index & BIT_MASK;
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[index >> 3] >> get_bit;
    result &= BIT_MASK;
#else
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[index >> 3] << get_bit;
    result >>= END_OFFSET - 1;
#endif
#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    index += (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8);
#else
    index++;
#endif
    s->index = index;

    return result;
}

In this modified variant, a new variable "get_bit" has been introduced. This variable holds the result of (s->index & 7), which was calculated twice in the original function. In this way, the modified version optimizes this computational step by storing the result in a dedicated variable.

Apart from introducing the "get_bit" variable, the if statement was eliminated. Instead, an arithmetic operation substitutes the if whose result is either an increment by one if the evaluated expression is true, or no change at all if the evaluated condition fails.

The BIT_MASK value should reflect 1 as it was used to do bit masking but for more readability BIT_MASK was used instead of directly writing 1 in the code. constants 'BIT_MASK' is '1' and 'END_OFFSET' is '8'.

To be noted because this variant includes the possibility of conditional compilation (use  #ifdef,  #else,  #endif), BITSTREAM_READER_LE and UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER should be properly defined before use in the programs.
