Here's a slight variant of the function `get_bits()`. In this version, the function operates equivalently but does a reversal operation on `tmp` before returning it. 


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp; 
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(n>0 && n<=25);
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    
    unsigned int reversed_num = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (tmp & (1 << i))
           reversed_num |= 1 << ((n - 1) - i);  
    }

    return reversed_num;  
}


This version of `get_bits()` reads a chunk of bits from *s into tmp, and then returns the bit-reversed version of tmp. Note the new loop which is created to reverse the bits of tmp. This changes the behavior of something in the function without impacting the output as such.

NOTE: The functionality of your current function heavily relies on undefined macros (open/close reader, update cache, etc.) and depending for complete accuracy on what those functions do this bit reversal step may not work properly. Please reassess based on your full code. 

This function's specification does not encourage variable modification in arbitrary manners as it might lead to system instability caused by unknown dependencies and side effects introduced. If you have to make changes, make sure it falls under your implementation's specification and all unit tests cases pass correspondingly.
