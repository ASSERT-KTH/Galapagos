Here is the alternative implementation for the given function. I slightly changed the method but maintained the original functionality.


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n)
{
    int shiftAmount;

    for (; n > 0; n--)
    {
        if (s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            if (*s->buf == 0xff)
                s->bit_index = 1; 
            else
                s->bit_index = 0;

            *(++s->buf) = 0;
        }
        shiftAmount = 7 - s->bit_index;
        *s->buf |= (val << shiftAmount) & (1 << shiftAmount);
        s->bit_index++;
    }
}

In this variant, we have used a more explicit approach to perform the various operations in the function like shifting and bitwise OR operation. This might sacrifice a bit of performance, but this approach may improve the readability, especially for those who are not familiar with the bitwise operations.
