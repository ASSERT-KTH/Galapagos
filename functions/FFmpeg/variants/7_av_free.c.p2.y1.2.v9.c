One potential transformation we can perform on the program is moving the conditional compilation statements to occur specifically in the conditional branch when it decides on which free function to use. We can also add a fail-safe, that will output an error if neither `HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC` is defined nor `free` is usable.


#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void av_free(void *ptr)
{
    #ifdef HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
        _aligned_free(ptr);
    #elif defined(free)
        free(ptr);
    #else
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: No valid free function found.\n");
        exit(1);
    #endif
}

This keeps the program wrapper visible so readers can understand the branching actions for the different free function calls at a glance. By doing this slight transformation, your code still keeps the same deterministic functionality recognizing the types of memory to be freed, but now explicitly documents what will happen if no free function can be found at compilation.
