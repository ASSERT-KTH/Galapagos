Sure, here is a variant that adds some form of error checking. The program now checks if the pointer passed to the function is not NULL before attempting to free the allocated memory. This maintains the original functionality of the program but adds a degree of safety to prevent freeing a null pointer.


#include <stddef.h>  // For NULL

void av_free(void *ptr)
{
    if (ptr != NULL)
    { 
#if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
        _aligned_free(ptr);
#else
        free(ptr);
#endif
    }
}


Remember to include `stddef.h` in the file where this function is declared, if it's not included yet, because it provides the definition for `NULL`.
