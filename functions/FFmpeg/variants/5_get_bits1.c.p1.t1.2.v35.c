One possible variation could look like the following:


static inline unsigned int get_bits2(GetBitContext *s) 
{
    unsigned int index_val = s->index;
    unsigned int output    = (unsigned int)s->buffer[index_val >> 3];
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    output = (output >> (index_val & 7)) & 1;
#else
    output = ((output << (index_val & 7)) & 255) >> 7;
#endif
#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (index_val < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
#endif
    output = (s->index = ++index_val, output);
	   
    return output;
}


In this variant, the build-up to the final "result" value is stored collectively within a single "output" variable instead of being stored with a changing "result" variable. The modulo and bitshift operations occur while new values are being assigned to this variable.

The name of the "index" variable was treated with appending '_val' for making it more descriptive.

The last "output" assignments happen simultaneously. The final "index" update has been combined into a single return statement using the comma operator. This makes it shorter but should still keep the intended behavior.
