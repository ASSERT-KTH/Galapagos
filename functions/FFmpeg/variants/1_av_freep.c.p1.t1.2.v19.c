Sure, there are several ways to alter the implementation while preserving its functionality. Here's one:


#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void av_freep(void *arg)
{
    void *val = *(void **)arg;
    *(void **)arg = NULL;
    free(val);
}


This version achieves the same result as the original. It dereferences the `arg` pointer to retrieve and store the content pointed by `arg` in `val`. Then it makes the content pointed by `arg` NULL before freeing what `val` previously pointing to. This is essentially maintaining the original functionality of freeing pointed memory and nullifying the pointer.   

Kindly ensure there has been a function named `free()` or `av_free()` declared somewhere in the project as this won't compile otherwise.
