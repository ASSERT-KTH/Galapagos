I assume your question entails to optimize or refactor the code while maintaining the original functionality. So I can change the implementation using different code-style while preserving logic:

In below slightly refactored version, we replace 'while' with 'for' loop, which provides better iteration control and more concise syntax.


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) 
{
    for(;n > 0;n--)
    {
        if (s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            s->bit_index = *s->buf == 0xff ? 1 : 0;
            *(++s->buf) = 0;
        }
        *s->buf |= (val << (7 - s->bit_index));
    }
    ++(s->bit_index);
}

In this refactored code:

 - For loop checks and decrements 'n' in the same place, streamlining the iterations.
 - Used ternary operator '? :' in setting 'bit index', reading it can be more straightforward comparing with the original one.
 - Incrementing 's->bit_index' happens outside of the loop to ensure the condition in loop is not varied in each iteration increasing the predictability. Although it makes the same overall result as the original, but also should note that this depends on the unknown side effects caused by the manipulation of this function - if original post increment placement is crucial, this codes loses compatibility with the initial.
    
In short, the ambition of refactor should accord upon proper balance with effort, potential risks, actual convenience of maintenance and efficiency improvements it offers.
