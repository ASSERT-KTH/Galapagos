Here is an optimized variant of the original function. The major change involves the reduction of repetitive read and write operations to the 'buf' field of 's'. In this optimised version, an additional local variable 'bufVal' is introduced which mirrors the value to which 'buf' points. Similar changes are also made for 'bitIndex'. The idea of these steps is to reduce the overhead by reading and writing to memory multiple times.

Here's the optimized version of the code:


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n)
{
    unsigned int bitIndex = s->bit_index;
    unsigned char bufVal = *s->buf;

    while(n-- > 0) 
    {
        if (bitIndex == 8)
        {
            if (bufVal == 0xff)
            {
                bitIndex = 1;
                bufVal = 1 << 7;
            }
            else
            {
                bitIndex = 0;
                bufVal = 0;
            }

            *s->buf = bufVal;
            s->bit_index = bitIndex;
            byte *tempAddr = ++s->buf;
            bufVal = *tempAddr;
        }
        else
        {
            bufVal |= val << (7 - bitIndex++);
        }
    }

    *s->buf = bufVal;
    s->bit_index = bitIndex;
}


This version simply compresses the common accesses to the same memory location into a single pipeline. It also writes to this memory location only once the procedure completes. This version leverages the mechanism that modern architectures use to speed up frequent memory accesses: memory access locality.

The function's original functionality is preserved, resorting only to optimization methods.
