Here are some alternate implementations in C which still maintain original function signature and functionalities:

1. Using a conditional check:

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    if (fmt != NULL) {
        va_start(vl, fmt);
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
        va_end(vl);
    }
}

   
2. Exception Handling with setjmp/handle mechanism:
This is a kind of "exception handling" often used in environments that do not natively support exceptions. Although uncommon and not considered very good practice, this is compliant with your requirements. Note that by error handling, I am pointing specifically that somewhere the code is using `setjmp()` to save the location, and

LONG_JUMP_IF_ERROR() to throw to the saved point. Replace these names with whatever functions are actually being used in library.

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    JUMP_BUF jmpbuf;
    if (!SET_JUMP_ERROR_MARKER(&jmpbuf)) {
        va_start(vl, fmt);
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
        va_end(vl);
    } else {
        /* some code to handle the error if av_vlog failed here */
    }
}

3. Swap operation sequence:

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_end(vl);        
    va_start(vl, fmt); 
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl); 
    va_start(vl, fmt);      
}
