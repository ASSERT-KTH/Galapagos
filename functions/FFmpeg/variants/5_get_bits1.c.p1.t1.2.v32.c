Here is a program variant that maintains the original function's functionality:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[index >> 3];

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = result >> (index & 7) & 1;
#else
    result = (result << (index & 7)) >> (8 - 1);
#endif

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
#endif
        s->index++;

    return result;
}


I simplified the `result` variable assignments by combining shifts, `and` operations, and assignments into a single statement. Given their lower precedence, parentheses are required to avoid any modified behaviour by always ensuring the arithmetics inside parentheses is evaluated first. Functionality has therefore been maintained by keeping runtime and outputs to be exactly the same.
