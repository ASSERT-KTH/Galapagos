Sure, here is a rewritten version of the function using bitwise operators:


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) 
{
    int mask;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0 ; i--)
    {
        mask = 1 << i;
        if ((val & mask) != 0)
        {
            if (s->bit_index == 8) 
            {
                s->bit_index = *s->buf == 0xff;
                *(++s->buf) = 0;
            }
            *s->buf |= 1 << (7 - s->bit_index);
        }
        else if (s->bit_index < 8 || *s->buf != 0xff) 
        {
            *s->buf |= 0 << (7 - s->bit_index);
        }
        s->bit_index++;
    }
}

Though this certainly has maintained the initial functionality and hasn't utilized any other auxiliary helper functions, please understand it gives a more clear bitwise dissection of original value using the mask in the loop. It then adheres to the updating pattern according to bitwise content but could have other consequent features as possible drawbacks depending on the complete associated working environment/module in place.
