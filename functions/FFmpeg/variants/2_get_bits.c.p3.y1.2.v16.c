Unfortunately, it's quite hard to give a perfect non-binary example due to some massive differences between C and Go (e.g., C allows manipulation at the byte/bit level - there's no strict equivalent of C's `register` keyword in Go, macros are used in the original code).

But, if necessary, we can use the `binary` package in Go to write/read bits. For instance, here's what the same general function pattern might look like in Go:

go
import (
	"encoding/binary"
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func getBits(s *GetBitContext, n int) (uint64, error) {
	if n <= 0 || n > 25 {
		return 0, fmt.Errorf("n must be in the range 1-25")
	}
	bufferSize := math.Min(float64(len(s.buf)*8), float64(n*8))
	bufferRemainder := uint64(bufferSize) % 8
	if bufferRemainder > 0 {
		var val uint64
		err := binary.Read(s.buf[:bufferSize/8], binary.LittleEndian, &val)
		s.buf = s.buf[bufferSize/8:]
		return val & (1<<bufferRemainder - 1), err
	} else {
		var val uint64
		err := binary.Read(s.buf, binary.LittleEndian, &val)
		s.buf = nil
		return val, err
	}
}

type GetBitContext struct {
	buf []byte
}


Please note that this is a relatively facsimile in Go and may not correctly reflect the precise semantics of the original C function. Complex bitwise operations like s MAY be done in C can't be so idiomatically done in Go, but the primary procedural parts can be translated pretty accurately. The error messages/forms are also a point of interpretive contention - please tailor them to your requirements.
