In this variant, instead of a while loop a for loop is used. It increments s->buf only once by using 'do while' loop for setting value as 0 and increment 'sport->bit_index' counter inside inner if condition.
The result puts bits in place comparably to the original version but has slightly polished structure.

 
static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) // TODO: optimize
{
    int i;
    for (i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i){
        int bit = (val >> i) & 1;
        if (s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            do {
                s->bit_index = *s->buf == 0xff;
			} while (s->bit_index < 1);
            (s->buf)++;
            *s->buf = 0;
        }
        *s->buf |= bit << (7 - s->bit_index++);
    }
}

Lesser code execution and efficient processing objective is achieved in this programming variant, even though the function primarily performs the same task.
