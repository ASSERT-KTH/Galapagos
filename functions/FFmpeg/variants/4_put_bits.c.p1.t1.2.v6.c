Here is a possible optimized function:


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) 
{
    for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)
    {
        if(s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            s->bit_index = (*s->buf == 0xff) ? 1 : 0;            
            *(++s->buf) = 0;
        }
        *s->buf |= ((val >> i) & 1) << (7 - s->bit_index++);
    }
}


In the optimized version, we're processing the bits from val in reverse order (most significant bit first to least significant bit last). This reflects the bitwise shifting operation in "val << (7 - s->bit_index++)" from the original reference  function as opposed to taking all bits at once. Here, we're shifting val to the right (from n to 0), then using '& 1' to isolate the sign bit at the shifting position. Next steps remain unchanged (assigning it to the corresponding bit in *s->buf).

Remember that one should scrutinize performance changes when tampering original code, sometimes optimizations might have inverse implications on real environments due to variable CPU features and processor architectures.

Please, review the changes above since compilers usually perform such elementary layer of optimization, keeping semantic intact. Moreover, operator costs can widely vary among platforms becoming this kind of manual tweak useless on practice.
