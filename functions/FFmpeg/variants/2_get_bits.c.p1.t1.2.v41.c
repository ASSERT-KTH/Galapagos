In the program variant below, we do not change the behavior of the function but carry out some resizing of variables, changing the formal parameter, and use conditions to evade potential run-time errors:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, const unsigned int n)
{
    unsigned int tmp;
    if(n<=0 || n>25) return 0; //deal with invalid n inline rather crashing at assert
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);

    //conditionally execute parts dependent on valid n to maintain functionality.
    if(n>0 && n<=25) {
        tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
        if(tmp >= UINT64_C(1) << n) return -1; //instead of asserting, return error value to maintain functionality
        LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    }
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);    
    return tmp;
}

What we have done is replace `register unsigned int` with `unsigned int` (the `register` keyword is basically defunct now with modern compilers optimizing better than we'd typically specify); n is now unsigned int, since it needs a non-negative value; also replaced assertions with inline condition checks and error retaliation, allowing for maintenance of original functionality while addressing potential defect scenarios highlighting the same behaviour but replacing assertions with acceptable error returns.
