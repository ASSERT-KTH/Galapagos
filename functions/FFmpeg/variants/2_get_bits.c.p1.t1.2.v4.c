Here is a program variant of the original function which changes its behavior slightly, but still gives the same result.
In our new version, we added comments (which is a behavior change without functionality change), reordered statements (as long as it doesn't change the particular protocol of calling these macros, it wouldn't matter in which order it's generally called), and added an extra assertion (just for checking purposes).


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    // initialize temporary variable
    register unsigned int temp;

    // use open reader macro on s
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    // assert if n is out of constraints
    av_assert2(n>0 && n <= 25);

    // checking cache
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    // get required bits from reader re and store in temp
    temp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);

    // assert if temp is beyond limit controlled by n
    av_assert2(temp < UINT64_C(1) << n);

    // do the skip according to received control n
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);

    // checking for overflow, additional feature
    av_assert2(temp + UINT64_C(1) << n > temp);

    // close reader after completing reading bits
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);

    // returning obtained unsigned int bit data
    return temp;
}

Toemphasize this since it wasn't specified in the original problem, context and documentation of these macros are unknown. The rewritten function assumes these macros do not depend on being called in an exact sequence (Except OPEN calls before others and CLOSE after others).
