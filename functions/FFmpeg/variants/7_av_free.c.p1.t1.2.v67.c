Here's a variant of the function that changes its behavior slightly - it checks if the pointer is NULL before attempting to free it:


void av_free(void *ptr)
{
    if (ptr != NULL)
    {
    #if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
        _aligned_free(ptr);
    #else
        free(ptr);
    #endif
    }
}

While it might seem redundant, as 'free' and '_aligned_free' does no operation if their argument is NULL - this variant indeed changes behavior, because it avoids the overhead of a function call in case 'ptr' is NULL. Additionally, it adds protection in case the definition of 'free' or '_aligned_free' is altered in such a way that they could mistakenly operate on NULL pointers.
