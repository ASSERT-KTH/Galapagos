Variant 1:

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
    return;
}

This variant simply adds a return statement at the end of the function. While not obligatory in a `void` function, it maintains the original functions logic and behavior. It just ends the function explicitly.

Variant 2:

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    if (fmt != NULL) 
    {
        va_list vl;
        va_start(vl, fmt);
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
        va_end(vl);
    } 
}

In this variant, before processing the arguments, a condition was added to verify if the "fmt" pointer is not null to avoid any unwanted behavior or undefined situation which can result if it is null.

Variant 3:

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    if(avcl != NULL && fmt != NULL)
    {
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    }    
    va_end(vl);
}

Condition to check if both pointers are not null before calling av_vlog() was added. va_list initialisation and deinitialisation stays untouched for cleanup. 

Variant 4:

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    if(level > 0) //some assumption related to minimally needed level, change per requirements
    {
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    }    
    va_end(vl);
}

Level parameter is used to introduce a conditional check that "pre-qualifies" the main functional code depending upon a condition. Assumptions related to specific level value being needed are in place as the method body aren't completely clear in context. 

Please note that because the handled function and exact context is not completely clear (especially inputs), these solutions assume multiple directions. Check needed edge cases and specific context scenarios and handle them accordingly.
