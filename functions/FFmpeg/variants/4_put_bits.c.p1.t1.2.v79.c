Here is the implementation.

static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) // Modified version
{
    int mask;
    while (n-- > 0){
        if (s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            *(s->buf) = *s->buf == 0xff ? 1 : 0;
            s->bit_index = *s->buf;
            *(++s->buf) = 0;
        }
        mask = 1 << (7 - s->bit_index);
        if((val & 1) != 0)
        {
            *s->buf = *s->buf | mask;
        }
        val= val >> 1;
        s->bit_index++;
    }
}

Explanation & Changes:
In the previous version, it was pointed that `s->bit_index = *s->buf == 0xff?`. This checks whether the value at s->buf is 0xff and if true, assigns 1 otherwise 0 to s->bit_index. The revised one adds little flexibility to the code also the bitwise OR seems to calculate its position by calculating a bit mask from the bit_index and only applying it iff the least significant bit of val is a 1. Rest remain as is. I hope it preserve the functionality of original.
Always looking for better solutions, so suggestions are welcome.
Please note that without intimate knowledge of this code's overall aim and context, these considerations are somewhat speculative. Whether or not these risks are relevant or problematic you should review internally based on a comprehensive understanding of your code base and system, and test any changes thoroughly.
