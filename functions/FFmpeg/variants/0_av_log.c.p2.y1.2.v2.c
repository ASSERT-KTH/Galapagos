Here is one way to vary the implementation while slightly altering the behavior and maintaining the function's original functionality:


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char* fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    if (level >= AV_LOG_WARNING) 
    {
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    }
    va_end(vl);
}


In this alternate implementation, an if-clause is added to ensure the `av_vlog()` function is only called if the log level is greater than or equal to `AV_LOG_WARNING`. This could serve to filter out superfluous debug or informational logs, for instance, thereby changing the behavior of the function but not its core functionality. Note that the `AV_LOG_WARNING` constant used here is a placeholder, replace it as per your need of logging level.
