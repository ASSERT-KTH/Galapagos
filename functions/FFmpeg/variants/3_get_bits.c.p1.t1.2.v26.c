In the variant version of the program, the presence of loop is transformed to a recursive function call. However, the function has the same applications and effects as the original.

Here's the source code:


static int get_bits(Jpeg2000DecoderContext *s, int n)
{
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    
    int res = get_bits(s, n - 1);
    res <<= 1;
    if (s->bit_index == 0) {
        s->bit_index = 7 + (bytestream2_get_byte(&s->g) != 0xFFu);
    }
    s->bit_index--;
    res |= (bytestream2_peek_byte(&s->g) >> s->bit_index) & 1;
    
    return res;
}

The recursive call to `get_bits()` decreases `n` by 1 each time until it becomes zero - the same behaviour as the `while (--n >= 0)` in the original code. While recursion can add extra overhead due to its function call-and-return mechanism, it does retain the original functioning of the same function but differs on the manner execution. Be cautious though that due to nature of recursion your program is slightly at risk of stack overflow for large inputs of `n`.
