The C code shown makes use of various macros (OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS, LAST_SKIP_BITS, CLOSE_READER), so without a direct equivalent in Go or information on how the macros are initialized and used, an equivalent Go function can't be created. The given C lines are looking for compiler pre-processor commands related to bit-wise operations not common in high-level languages.

Thus, it can't be translated to Go as it is. However,  Go's binary package can perform bit-wise operations. Consequences without these macros can lead to significant performance differences that may not be acceptable depending on the use of the function.

Still attempting a translation:

go
type GetBitContext struct {
   // Context variables and functions equivalent to the replaced macros...
}

func GetBits(s *GetBitContext, n int) (int, error) {
    if n < 0 {
       return 0, errors.New("Number of bits cannot be negative")
    }
    if n > 25 {
       return 0, errors.New("Number of bits must be < 25")
    }
    re := *(Get the value from OPEN_READER instruction)
     
    they contain implementation equivalent to `UPDATE_CACHE(re, s)`
    tmp := ShowUBits(re, s, n)

    they contain implementation equivalent to `LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n)`
    
    re = *(Close the reader from CLOSE_READER instruction)

    return tmp, nil
}
