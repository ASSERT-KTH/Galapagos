Here a variant of the original function where the functionality remains consistent but the behavior changes: switch-case was used instead of if and else, hence giving it a twist by prioritizing cases where the bit index is more frequently greater than 0.

That is, the fundamentally same calculations for shifting bits, getting bytes from a bytestream, and manipulating a bit index. In addition, in the case the processing sequence has changed but not the outcome.

static int get_bits(Jpeg2000DecoderContext *s, int n)
{
    int res = 0;
    while (--n >= 0) 
    {
        res <<= 1;
        switch(s->bit_index)
        {
            case 0:
                s->bit_index = 7 + (bytestream2_get_byte(&s->g) != 0xFFu);
                /* failling through intentionally */
            default:
                 s->bit_index--;
                 break;
        }
        res |= (bytestream2_peek_byte(&s->g) >> s->bit_index) & 1;
    }
    return res;
}
