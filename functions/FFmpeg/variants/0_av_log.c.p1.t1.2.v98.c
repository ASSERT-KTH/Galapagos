You can maintain the overall functionality of the original function while changing its behavior slightly through conditions. For instance, you can add a condition to check if `level` is above/below/equal to a certain threshold and then carry out the functions accordingly.

While the description of the changes required is vague, an example with an added condition might look like this:

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    if (level > 10) {                   // Example change - adding condition check     
        // Conditional behaviour: increase level
        // Note: This behaviour might not make sense if level codes/indicators are predefined/have a maximum. This is just for illustrative purposes.
        av_vlog(avcl, level+1, fmt, vl);  
    }
    else 
    {    // Rest of the function maintains original behaviour
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    }
    va_end(vl);
}

In this variant, if `level` is above `10`, the program modifies it before passing it to `av_vlog`. For all other entries, the original functionality of passing the `level` as it is remains. The rest of the function retains its original function/meaning. 

This method maintains the function's signature, needs no additional helper function and changes the function behaviour, albeit trivially, while maintaining what might reasonably considered its overall functionality intact - receiving some sort of logging-context pointer `avcl`, log `level`, a message string with format placeholders, and a variable number of arguments which are used within this original `av_vlog` function.
  
Kindly note the ellipsis (...), which represent a possible list of further of arguments, specific handling depending on the internal logics of `av_vlog()` are not covered above. Normal logging function tends to interpret these in the light of the `fmt` argument, a format string containing placeholders where each of them is substituted with variable-respective string representation. 

Please modify according to the exact details and restrictions of your modification/fitness criteria need.
