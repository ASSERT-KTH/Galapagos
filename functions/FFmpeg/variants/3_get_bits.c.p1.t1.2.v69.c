Sure, here is a variant of the code that both maintains the functionality of the original one and changes its behavior - by changing its structure. In this variant, I replaced the while loop with a cycle for structure and changed utilizing bitwise operation syntax increment while the rest still works in the same way. 


static int get_bits(Jpeg2000DecoderContext *s, int n)
{
    int res = 0;
    
    for (; n-- > 0; res <<= 1) {      
        if (!s->bit_index) {
            s->bit_index = 7 + (bytestream2_get_byte(&s->g) != 0xFFu);  
        }

        s->bit_index--;
        res |= (bytestream2_peek_byte(&s->g) >> s->bit_index) & 1; 
    }
    
    return res;
}


A for loop makes this code less prone to errors due to the repetition control structures, make the code easier to understand and write. As good coding practice suggests, we use a FOR loop when the number of iterations is known beforehand while a WHILE loop would have been a better choice when the number of iterations are known after executing the code block.
