The function can be modified as follows:


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n)
{
    do{
        if (s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            ++(s->buf);
            s->bit_index = (*s->buf == 0xff) ? 1 : 0;
            *s->buf = 0;
        }
       
        *s->buf |= (val % 2) << (7 - s->bit_index);
        val >>= 1;
        ++(s->bit_index);
     
    } while(--n > 0);
}


Here:
- `s-> buf` is incremented with post-fix, allowing it to access a new bit-field slot.
- Ternary operator checks and updates the bit_index for special byte `0xff`.
- The approach order for encoding the value `val` is reversed(using bitwise right operation).
- Bit_index incrementation became a standalone for easy code parsing.
- The expected behaviors are retained though some internal operation is slightly modified minimizing impact to execution speed ensuring a safe refactor.
