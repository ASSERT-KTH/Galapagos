This option slightly tweaks the original version by incrementing the index variable immediately after reading the result from the buffer. Furthermore, it also pushes the index-checking and increment operations into a conditional scope to compensate for the initial increment operation performed earlier but retains the broad range of potential behavior the original code exhibited. Please note that this might change performance or thread safety characteristics of function.
