Sure, there are variety of ways that I can refactor this code to maintain the same functionality while changing its structure. Here's one of them:


static inline unsigned int get_bits2(GetBitContext *s)
{
    s->index++;
    unsigned int index = s->index - 1;

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[index >> 3] >> (index & 7) & 1;
#else
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[index >> 3] << (index & 7) >> (8 - 1);
#endif

    if (s->index > s->size_in_bits_plus8) 
    {
        s->index--;
        return 0; 
    }

    return result;
}
 

The function will behave in identically the same manner but operates slightly differently. First, the s->index is increased, at first in order to avoid its maintaining in a case if it doesn't fill under the your condition. Lastly after all operations, function will check the condition if the s->index went beyond size_in_bits_plus8 then assign the s->index with less value that have done and returns the default unsigned integer value zero. Otherwise, process the true part value and returns computed result. It doesn't affect the functionality but changes the code order which might lead to some different machine instructions due to optimization compiler might do. Functions have the same signature.
