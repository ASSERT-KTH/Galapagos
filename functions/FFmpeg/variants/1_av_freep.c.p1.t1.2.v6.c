void av_freep(void *arg)
{
    // Directly assigning val
    void *val = *((void**)arg);
    // Directly nullifying *arg
    *((void**)arg) = NULL;
    av_free(val);
}

The original function used memcpy to copy the value from `arg` to `val` and also to set `arg` to `NULL`. Now instead of using memcpy, the provided variant uses direct assignment which is usually more efficient. Considering `arg` is of type `void**`, the dereferencing operation is used for the same.
Both the original version and the variant version achieves the same functionality: Free the memory which `arg` is pointing and set `arg` to NULL.
