Here's a variant of the original function with some modifications. It maintains the original functionality, but introduces trivial code rearrangements and changes in code structure:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    if(n <= 0 || n > 25) {
        /* handle an error or exit */
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    if(tmp >= UINT64_C(1) << n) {
        /* handle an error or exit */
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    return tmp;
}

Some things we did differently this time:
1. Introduced condition checks as `exit()`, as opposed to `av_assert2()`
2. Provided error handling if the conditions fail – an alternate way of handling these conditions and executing proper error handling. We need the `<stdlib.h>` library for `exit()` and `EXIT_FAILURE`. Remember that we call `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)` in serious cases of failures (this stops the program).
Keep in mind that mature, production grade code handles all kinds of unexpected situations and does not call `exit()` so casually. However, in a demonstration here, it’s okay.
