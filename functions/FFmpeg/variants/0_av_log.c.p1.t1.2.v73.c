In this variant of the original function, a conditional is added to check the level before executing av_vlog. This modification would allow a user to "silence" the logging function at certain levels by checking the verbosity level and only continues if the level is under a defined threshold.


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    
    // only proceed if the level is below a certain threshold
    if (level < LOG_THRESHOLD)
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);

    va_end(vl);
}

In this code snippet, LOG_THRESHOLD is a predefined value. Depending on this value, logs with a higher level than LOG_THRESHOLD will not perform `av_vlog` operation and will not be logged. However, note that this introduces a dependency on a globally defined constant (LOG_THRESHOLD), which can affect maintainability and readability if not property managed.
