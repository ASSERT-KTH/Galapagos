Here is a variant of the original function. This code modifies some small details of the implementation but is but logically identical. It just utilizes ternary operators in place of if statement for updating the index and uses increment operator on s->index rather than using a variable to store it.


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    uint8_t result     = s->buffer[s->index >> 3];
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result >>= s->index & 7;
    result  &= 1;
#else
    result <<= s->index & 7;
    result >>= 8 - 1;
#endif
#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    s->index = (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8) ? ++s->index : s->index;
#else
    ++s->index;
#endif

    return result;
}
 

This program will do the same purpose as your given C code. However, the index is updated a bit differently: instead of creating a new variable, we directly increment s->index. It could be slightly less readable but maintain the functionality depends on UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER definition and checks `s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8`.
