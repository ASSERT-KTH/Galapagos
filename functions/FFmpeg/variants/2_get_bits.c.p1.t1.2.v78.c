A variant could include minor changes such as renaming variables or rearranging code, but still, it must deliver the same functionality as the original one. Here is a program variant:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int res;
    av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25);
    OPEN_READER(vr, s);    
    UPDATE_CACHE(vr, s);
    res = SHOW_UBITS(vr, s, n);
    av_assert2(res < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(vr, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(vr, s);
    return res;
}

This version essentially performs the same operations, but with the variable `tmp` renamed to `res` and `re` reader renamed to `vr`. Functionally, it's identical to the original but structurally it is slightly different.
