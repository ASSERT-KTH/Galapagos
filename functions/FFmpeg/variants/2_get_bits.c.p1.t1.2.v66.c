In the provided code, the `av_assert2()` function calls are essentially used for validation points in debugging as they perform no operation in the release version. 

This given code gets the bit directly before an update and changing the behaviour without losing the original functionality of the code is open to interpretation. In the variant, the first `av_assert2()` is replaced with an if statement that throws an "Error" when an out of bound index `(n <= 0 || n > 25)` is attempted to access.

Here is the code. 


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp;
    if(n <= 0 || n > 25) 
      {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: Index out of bounds range (1-25).");
        return 0;
      }
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    return tmp;
}

Now, if an invalid `n` value is provided (where `n <= 0` OR `n > 25`), "Error: Index out of bounds range (1-25)." will be printed to `stderr` & the function will return 0 which prevents the unexpected consequences of accessing an out of bounds index. Other program's behaviour did not change.
