Sure, here's a variant of your function. I have maintained the structure and simply rearranged the operations without changing its functionality:

static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s) {

/*
Assuming GetBitContext is a structure 
which has been defined somewhere in the program 
as something like:

struct GetBitContext {
    unsigned int index;
    uint8_t* buffer;
    int size_in_bits_plus8;
}; 
*/

    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result     = s->buffer[index >> 3];

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
#endif
        index++;
    s->index = index;    

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result >>= index & 7;
    result  &= 1;
#else
    result <<= index & 7;
    result >>= 8 - 1;
#endif

    return result;
}

The only changes made were to move the increment of the index field and its statement of assignment to the middle of the function prior to `#ifdef` conditional preprocessor directive. As these operations do not depend on conditional compilation nor the previously executed code within the function, it doesn't change the output of the function. Please ensure that it gives your expected results in your specific context.
