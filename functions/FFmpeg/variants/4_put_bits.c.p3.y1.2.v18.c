You cannot maintain the exact original function's signature when transforming from C to Go due to language-specific feature. For translating the code being a semantically equivalent, here is a functional Go version:

go
type Jpeg2000EncoderContext struct {
	BitIndex int
	Buf      *[]byte
}

func (s *Jpeg2000EncoderContext) PutBits(val int, n int) { 
	if *s.Buf == nil {
		*s.Buf = make([]byte, 1)
	}

	for n > 0 {
		if s.BitIndex == 8 {
			s.BitIndex = 0
			if (*s.Buf)[len(*s.Buf)-1] == 0xff {
				s.BitIndex = 1
			}
			
			*s.Buf = append(*s.Buf, 0)
		}

		(*s.Buf)[len(*s.Buf)-1] |= byte(val << (7 - s.BitIndex))
		
		s.BitIndex++
		n--
	}
}


In this modification, the bits are manipulated in Go by marshalling the buffer into bytes and using the bitwise OR assignment operator. The Jpeg2000EncoderContext has been modified as a struct with Capitalize fields so they can be accessed and the function is made semantically similar to the original function by converting C pointer to slice in Golang. The infinite loop in C equivalent has been translated to a standard for loop, since Go discourages the use of endless loop
The `(*s.Buf)[len(*s.Buf)-1]` statement accesses the last byte of the buffer, equivalent to *(++s->buf) in C.
