The asked variant maintains the original functionality by shifting the invocation of the `av_vlog()` function into a condition checking if `avcl` isn't NULL, which might output potential beneficial debugging implementations.

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    
    if (avcl != NULL)
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    
    va_end(vl);
}

In this variant, the functionality that passes the `avcl` variable, `level` value, and arguments from `fmt` to `av_vlog()` persists, the behavior is altered to exclude cases where `avcl` is NULL, hence modifying any influence by `av_log()` over `av_vlog()` void function.
