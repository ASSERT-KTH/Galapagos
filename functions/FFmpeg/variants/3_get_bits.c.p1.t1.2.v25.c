Below is the variant program for the given function. The original functionality is maintained by implementing the same logic but the statements are rearranged and combined to alter the behavior of how the program runs.


static int get_bits(Jpeg2000DecoderContext *s, int n) 
{
    int res = 0;
    for(int i=n; i > 0 ; i--) {
        res *= 2;
        int new_bit = bytestream2_get_byte(&s->g) != 0xFFu;
        if (s->bit_index == 0) {
            s->bit_index = 7 + new_bit;
        }
        res |= (bytestream2_peek_byte(&s->g) >> --s->bit_index) & 1;
    }
    return res;
}


In this given variant, instead of using `while (--n >= 0)` loop, a `for` loop is used. This provides the same functionality but changes the behavior of how the cycle process operates. Also, to make the code more efficient, the boolean value used to modify bit_index (based on whether the first byte was 0xFF) is only calculated once and stored in new_bit which is then used in two different places. Other than these, the core functionality remains the same as the original function.
