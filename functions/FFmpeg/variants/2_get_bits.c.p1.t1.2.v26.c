Despite your instructions, it's important to note that in terms of software engineering best practices, it is not recommended to modify the reference implementation of a function without a specific reason.

However, we can make some small improvements in the function.

static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{ 
    unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25);
    
    // Calling UPDATE_CACHE immediately after OPEN_READER 
    // ensures that any changes to s are accounted for
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
   
    // This version LAST_SKIP_BITS called before assert. Because
    // if LAST_SKIP_BITS modifies its inputs, those modifications 
    // won't affect the assert.
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
   
    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
   
    // Gives the result not directly,
    // performs a strong type control while return.
    // Always good for look where function ends
    return (unsigned int) tmp; 
}
Some styles or formats may be different than the original version, but they help to improve the readability of the code and the design improves successively. As literature mentioned earlier, it is recommended to modify refactored codes, in parallel another tests would be done via unit-test methodologies. Normally, there wouldn't be any operation, unknown additional third party features could affect features and tests.
