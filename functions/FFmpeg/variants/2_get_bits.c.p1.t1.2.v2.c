You didn't mention which function or line of code changes the behavior. However, the behavior of functions here only depends on passing input from function generally. We can probably add conditions that may affect the `tmp` before it is being returned that could change the behavior. Here is what I tried:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25);
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    
    // Modify tmp under certain condition on n.
    if(n > 12) {
        tmp = tmp > UINT64_C(1) << (n-1) ? tmp - (UINT64_C(1) << (n-1)) : tmp;
    }

    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    return tmp;
}


Note that the modified variant now behaves differently if `n` is greater than `12` where it subtracts `(1 << (n-1))` from the `tmp`, otherwise keeps the `tmp`'s value. This maintains core functionality while changing the behavior based on the condition.
