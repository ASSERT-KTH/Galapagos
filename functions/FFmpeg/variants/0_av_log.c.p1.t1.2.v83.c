Your task can be understood in multiple ways. Assuming that "changing the behavior of the original function" you mean to add something like logging or counting the number of function calls, it could look directly like this (without changing the function's effect, its usability and interfaces):


static int call_counter = 0;
void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    call_counter += 1;

    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
}


In the context of this function does not have any 'visible side effects', the real functionality is totally delivered by `av_vlog`; Hence, a modified version that can still 'behave as the original' would be achieved by isolating the implementation inside an 'if' condition from a type of flag:


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    int new_behavior_active = 1;
    if (new_behavior_active) {
        va_list vl;
        va_start(vl, fmt);
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
        va_end(vl);
    }
}


Notice that: Both designs retain the signature of the original function and maintain its functionality, although incorporating new benign behavior.

DOUBLE-CHECK YOUR REQUIREMENTS: This response was written under an interpretation about the task in question which seems to be literature-related, more than engineering-focused. You were not applying accurately the vocab judging by the characteristics of the device concerned ("modify behavior" / "preserve original functionality" / "preserve signature of the function"), which are certainly contrasting conditions in the function evolution field. Thus, measure your specificity level while dealing help with accurate explanations.
