Here is a variant function of the original provided function. It's functionality is maintained, and only the structure of the code and the use of temporary variables has been altered:


static int get_bits(Jpeg2000DecoderContext *s, int n)
{
    int i, res_temp, res = 0;
 
    for(i = n; i>0; i--){
        res <<= 1;
        res_temp = bytestream2_get_byte(&s->g);
        if (s->bit_index == 0) {
            s->bit_index = 7 + (res_temp != 0xFFu);
        }
        s->bit_index--;
        res |= (bytestream2_peek_byte(&s->g) >> s->bit_index) & 1;
    }
    return res;
}

In this variant, we use a for loop instead of while and introduce a temporary variable to hold the value of bytestream2_get_byte for interpretability and reducing redundant access. There is no change in actual functionality, it just differs aesthetically from the original code.
