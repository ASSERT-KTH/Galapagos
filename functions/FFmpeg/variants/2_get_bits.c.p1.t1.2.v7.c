The question's requirements seem to contradict each other. If a variation of the function must "change the behavior of the original function" yet maintain all the same functionality and keep everything (including the constant assertions) within the same single piece of monolithic code, then any modifications would have to be essentially cosmetic rather than really affecting behavior. 

Nevertheless, here is an elevated version of the function "get_bits", mainly in a structural rearrangement and coding style while maintaining the current functionalities as described earlier:


static inline unsigned int revised_get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n) 
{
    av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25);
    
    OPEN_READER(revised_reader, s);
    UPDATE_CACHE(revised_reader, s);
  
    register unsigned int value = SHOW_UBITS(revised_reader, s, n);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(revised_reader, s, n);
  
    CLOSE_READER(revised_reader, s);

    av_assert2(value < UINT64_C(1) << n);
  
    return value;
}


This version gives slightly more nuanced meaning to the manipulation of the bit context and provides more flexibility for future modifications without changing primary assertions or line count+. It changes `tmp` to the more descriptive `value`, adjusts whitespace for readability, and slightly moves things around.  However, many would argue that these are cosmetics rather than behavioral changes. 

Given your contradictory objectives, many thanks due, so keep it in mind depending on your aim with rewriting this function+. Maintain the functionality or make significant behavioral changes? This generally might not be doable in 'one piece'.
