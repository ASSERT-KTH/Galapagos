In this variant, integer division `/` and the modulus operator `%` are used as alternatives to bit manipulation operators (`>>`,`<<`, and `&`). This makes the code more readable.
The addition operator `+=` was used as an alternative to incrementation by 1, without changing the original logic.
These changes don't affect the functionality of the code but stand as an alternative way of achieving same results.
