Here's a program variant for the provided function:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result     = s->buffer[index >> 3];
    
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = (result >> (index & 7)) & 1;
#else
    result = (result << (index & 7)) >> (8 - 1);
#endif

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
        s->index++;
#else
    s->index = ++index;
#endif
    
    return result;
}


In this variant, the index increment procedure remains the same but is placed inside the respective #if #else statement. By changing the order and grouping of the operations for getting the result variable inside the respective macros, it still functionality remains intact, but it does look different compared to the original code.
