Sure, the main logic of the function should not be changed, except the minor addition -- an extra variable to store `tmp`. Here's how I would retain the functionality while changing the behavior by making use of 'Bitwise operations' and an intermediate variable `intermediateVal`:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp, intermediateVal;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25);
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    intermediateVal = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    tmp = intermediateVal & (~(~0U << n));
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    return tmp;
}

In the above modified variant, the result from `SHOW_UBITS` is first stored to `intermediateVal`. The bits assigned to `tmp` are extracted by performing a bitwise AND (`&`) muting all bits except the ones we are interested in getting, established by the (~(~0U << n)) piece - which mask bits up to the 'n' value. 

Please replace the macros/inline functions starting from UPPER case letters (`OPEN_READER`, `av_assert2`, `UPDATE_CACHE`, `SHOW_UBITS`, `LAST_SKIP_BITS`, `CLOSE_READER`) with the actual bodies of these macros/functions and the required code modifications if any within them. You may consider replacing 'tmp' usages inside these macros with 'intermediateVal' if these macros extend/change bits.
