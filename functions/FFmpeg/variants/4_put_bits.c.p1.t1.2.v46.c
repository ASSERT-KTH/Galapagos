Here is one such option that effectively reorganizes the while loop logic without modifying its intended functionality. It also indirectly optimizes the function a bit, thereby potentially matching the original developer's TODO comment:


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) 
{
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if (s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            s->bit_index = (*s->buf == 0xff ? 1 : 0);
            *(++s->buf) = 0;
        }
        *s->buf |= val << (7 - s->bit_index++);
    }
}


What the refactored function does differently is it takes away the decrement operation from the control condition of loop and implements a standard for loop. This results in simpler and better synoptical understanding of the code to observer but with equivalent effect to original implementation.
