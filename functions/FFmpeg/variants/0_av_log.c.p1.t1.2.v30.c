void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    if (level <= AV_LOG_DEBUG) {
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    }
    va_end(vl);
}

In the program variant, the behavior of the original function `av_log` is changed to only print logs if the logging level is less than or equal to `AV_LOG_DEBUG`. However, the original functionality of logging specified type of logs is still maintained without creating auxiliary or helper functions and with the same function signature. Here `AV_LOG_DEBUG` is the debug log level and by checking whether `level` falls in this category or any fine-grained ones, we're controlling how excessive the logging should be.
Please Note: You'll need to define the logging level `AV_LOG_DEBUG` (as it isn't there in the given snippet) based on the requirement of what logging levels you want to allow. This approach works well in libraries with different levels of logging.
