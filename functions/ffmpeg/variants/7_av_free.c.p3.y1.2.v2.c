In Go, there's no exact equivalent as memory allocation does happen without having any special variants for aligned allocation. Therefore, all memory that will be freed up will be done by the garbage collector and doesn't need to be explicitly handled by the developer.

However, if the intent is to make the data structure accessible to C code or to free up memory that has been specifically allocated by C, then the `"C"` package may be used. Still, please note that handling memory this way is not idiomatic Go and should be avoided if possible.

Here's a very rough approximation of how it could be implemented (the maintain the original function signature promise cannot be held):

go
// #cgo CFLAGS: -DHAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
//
// #include <stdlib.h>
//
// void go_free(void *ptr) {
// #if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
//     _aligned_free(ptr);
// #else
//     free(ptr);
// #endif
// }
import "C"
import "unsafe"

func avFree(ptr unsafe.Pointer) {
    C.go_free(ptr)
}

This code essentially invokes a C function of a similar role from a Go function.

Be aware that properly managing memory across Go and C and maintaining matching lifecycle for objects on both sides of the boundary is challenging and comes with many caveats. Be sure to fully understand those before putting similar code to live production.
