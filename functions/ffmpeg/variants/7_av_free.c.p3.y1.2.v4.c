Since Go does not have pre-processor directives like C, it's not exactly possible to provide a direct conversion. But here's an approximation.

Go uses garbage collection, which means that we don't need to explicitly free memory. Go automatically frees memory when it goes out of scope or is no longer referenced. But if you definitely need to free something (like in case of buffers, files or C APIs), you may use the close or defer constructs. We'll use a boolean variable to simulate the HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC macro.

Here's an example:

go
import "os"

var HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC bool

// Assuming the 'ptr' refers to an open file.
func av_free(ptr *os.File) {
	if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC {
		// Custom cleanup code.
		ptr.Close()
	} else {
		// General cleanup.
		ptr.Close()
	}
}


Please, note, that it's an abstract example, because in Go explicit "free" actions are dependent of the real data behind the pointer but you don't provide what it is the actual data.
