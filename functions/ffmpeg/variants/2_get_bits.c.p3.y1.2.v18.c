While it is possible to translate some parts of your original C function to Go, constructing an identical function isn't compatible due to Go's architectural style and some specific functions you are using in the code snippet.

Go doesn't directly support working with bits in a way encapsulated in your specific set of macros (OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS, SKIP_BITS). The stated specific macros are mostly using bitwise operations on buffers of some kind that Go performs somewhat differently, mainly because Go tends to be stricter about types and safety. 

However, the following serves as a basic starting point for writing a corresponding Go function preserved with the limited amount of information:

go
type GetBitContext struct {
    // Your struct fields here
}

func getBits(s *GetBitContext, n int) (uint, error) {
    var tmp uint
    // define OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS, LAST_SKIP_BITS according to your program

    // ensure n is within accepted parameter
    if (n <= 0 || n > 25){
        return 0, errors.New("n should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 25.")
    }
    // You could do some bitwise operation or similar here with `s` and `n`, depending on what is stored in the `GetBitContext`
    // operations equivalent to those macros would go here
    //
    // if tmp after those manipulations is an specific large unsigned 64 bit int, return an error or handle accordingly
    if tmp >= 1<<uint(n) {
        return 0, errors.New("'tmp' is too large for specified number of bits.")
    }
    return tmp, nil
}


It's essential to re-define `OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS, LAST_SKIP_BITS` according to your Go guideline. It may also require you to understand the definition of `GetBitContext` struct. Both real native implementation for these parts are omitted in this translated version because they're highly dependent on the corresponding data structure and behavior within your existing codes.
