Due to language differences between C and Go, certain features in C cannot be directly translated to Go without significantly changing the functional signatures you asked to remain unchanged. That's because Go takes a different approach than C regarding variadic functions and pointers.

It's necessary to note that in Go we need an import statement to use formatted I/O (the "fmt" package). Also, for simplicity, let's represent the first parameter (void* avcl in C code) as an interface{} type.

The semantically closest version of the function would be something like the following:

go
import "fmt"

func av_log(avcl interface{}, level int, format string, a ...interface{}) {
    fmt.Printf(format, a...)
}

This is adhering the closest to the original C version, but depending on what the `av_vlog` function does, we might need to adjust this Go function.
