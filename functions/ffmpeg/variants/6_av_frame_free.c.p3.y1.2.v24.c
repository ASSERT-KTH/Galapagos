The C function `av_frame_free(AVFrame **frame)` which includes AVFrame as a pointer pointer can't be implemented directly in Go, as Go doesn't support pointer to pointers directly like in C. However, an equivalent function may be created in Go by passing a pointer to 'AVFrame' and then setting it to 'nil' like the following:


Go
func av_frame_free(frame **AVFrame) {
    if frame == nil || *frame == nil {
        return
    }

    av_frame_unref(*frame)
    *frame = nil
}

Just be careful that in Golang, setting a pointer to nil wouldn't actually free the associated memory. The garbage collector in Golang will automatically do memory management for you. This will set the value of the pointer to nil, which may allow earlier garbage collection if there are no other references to the value.----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trying to perform two levels of indirectionâ€”the equivalent of freeing a pointer-to-a-pointer in C (using ** in C ) will not in golang do what it would in C Instead, it is generally cleaned up when they go out of scope, which can be just a standard part of the behavior in Go language without the manual memory effort by the developer.

Maybe you can still use different ways to better manage memory access based on program needs.
