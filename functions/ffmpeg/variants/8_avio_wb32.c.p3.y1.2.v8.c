Go does not directly support pointer semantics like C. However since the function involves writing to IO context assuming "avio_w8" refers to writing a byte at the given IO context in FFmpeg, then we are essentially dealing with IO operation. The nearest correlate in Go would involve an equivalent byte writing method such as Writer.

Here's the semantically equivalent version in Go (assume necessary packages are already imported):

Go
func avio_wb32(s io.Writer, val uint32) {
    err := binary.Write(s, binary.BigEndian, val)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("binary.Write failed:", err)
    }
}


It should be noted, compared to low-level languages like C, Go abstracts away the nitty gritty of handling bit operations and byte writes, giving a safer and higher level mechanism for achieving such (like 'binary.Write'), but it validates provided Writer and data, then writes to it maintains binary (big endian or little endian) format of data.
