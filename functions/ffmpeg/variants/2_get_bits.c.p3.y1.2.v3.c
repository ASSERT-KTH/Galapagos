It's not completely possible to make a literal translation or maintain the exact function's signature because C and Go have different paradigms and features. However, here is an attempt to convert it, provided some assumptions have been made, such as GetBitContext, OPEN_READER and other macro operations have proper equivalent in Golang.

go
func getBits(s *GetBitContext, n int) (uint, error) {
    var tmp uint
    if n > 0 && n <= 25 {
        updateCache(s)
        tmp = showUbits(s)
        skipLastBits(s)
    } else {
        return 0, errors.New("bit rate out of range")
    }
    
    if tmp < uint64(1) << n {
        return tmp, nil
    } 

    return 0, errors.New("invalid temp value")
}


Please note in Go, assertion operations are done via error handling as Go does not traditionally center around assertions like C. Therefore, instead of direct assertions, the go code utilizes error handling.

Macros are functions in C that direct compilation behavior. Go does not necessarily have macro equivalents, so adjustments need to be made to translate some of the behaviors expected from macros like `UPDATE_CACHE` or `SHOW_UBITS`. This example treats them like functions to generate an analogous result but actual Go code may differ depending on how they fit into the broader code base. 

Moreover, `UINT64_C` in C is for the portability of literal values across different systems while using exact-width integer types. Goâ€™s uint and int types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems. For this reason the Go program should use the uint64() function to achieve a similar function to `UINT64_C(1)`. The exact translation, however, depends on the rest of your system setup and code ecosystem.
