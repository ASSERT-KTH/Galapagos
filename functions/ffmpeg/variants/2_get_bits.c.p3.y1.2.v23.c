It is not directly possible to create a one-to-one identical function in Golang due to differences in language concepts like macros and pointer manipulations which are commonly used in C but aren't present in Go. Macros being used here (OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS, LAST_SKIP_BITS, CLOSE_READER) are not supported in Go. 

Here's my attempt on the conversion assuming those macro doing bitwise operations. Also, go doesn't support assertions like "av_assert2", hence it is replicated using an if condition.


func getBits(s BitContext,  n int) uint32 {
    var tmp uint32

    // Assuming equivalent operation of these macros
    // OPEN_READER(re, s);
    // UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    re := s.re 
    cache := s.cache

    // reference to SHOW_UBITS macro is reinterpreted
    tmp = cache.peekBitsUnmaskedAndRefill(re, n).getBits()

    // reference to LAST_SKIP_BITS, CLOSE_READER is reinterpreted
    s.skipBits(n)
    re = nil

    // Translation for "av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n)"
     if !(tmp < uint64(1) << n) {
        panic("Assertion failed: tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n")
    } 

    return tmp
}
 
Note: There is no direct translation available due to language limitations, hence it assumes BitContext and methods similar to macros. Also, function fail using the panic function if assertion failed.
