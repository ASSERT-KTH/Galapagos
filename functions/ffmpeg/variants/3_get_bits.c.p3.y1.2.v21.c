In Go programming language, we can't utilize pointers or mutable parameters in the same manner as in C. Hence,in this Go version, we'll have to return modified Jpeg2000DecoderContext as a result of function.

go
type Jpeg2000DecoderContext struct {
    bitIndex uint8
    g        BytesStream2
}

type BytesStream2 struct{} // Assuming this is a struct, definition of which is not available in the original context

func (b *BytesStream2) getByte() uint8 {
    return 0 // hypothetical method in a hypothetical struct
}

func (b *BytesStream2) peekByte() uint8 {
    return 0 // hypothetical method in a hypothetical struct
}

func getBits(s Jpeg2000DecoderContext, n int) (Jpeg2000DecoderContext, int) {
    res := 0
    for n--; n >= 0; n-- {
        res <<= 1
        if s.bitIndex == 0 {
            if s.g.getByte() != 0xFF {
                s.bitIndex = 8
            } else {
                s.bitIndex = 7
            }
        }
        s.bitIndex--
        res |= int((s.g.peekByte() >> s.bitIndex) & 1)
    }
    return s, res
}


Here's the Go version of the function. It should essentially do the same thing as the initial C code, but it follows the idioms of Go : values are immutable by default,and if you want to mutate an input, a typical approach is to return it as output.
