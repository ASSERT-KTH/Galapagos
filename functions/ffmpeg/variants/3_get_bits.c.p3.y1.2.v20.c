While it's impossible to provide a like-for-like version due to differences between the C and Go standard libraries, below is an analogous function in Go that extracts n bits from a reader, returning the resulting int and an error if one occurred. 

It's also worth noting that handling image decoding—particularly for formats like JPEG 2000—is not a straightforward process. Libraries like "image/jpeg" are nearly universally used instead of attempting to read the JPEG 2000 format manually.

go
import (
    "errors"
    "io"
)

type Jpeg2000DecoderContext struct {
    g            io.Reader
    bitIndex     uint8
    current byte
}

func getBits(s *Jpeg2000DecoderContext, n int) (res int, err error) {
    res = 0

    for n > 0 {
        res <<= 1
        if s.bitIndex == 0 {
            var b [1]byte
            _, err = io.ReadFull(s.g, b[:])
            if err != nil {
                return
            }
            s.current = b[0]
            s.bitIndex = 7
            if s.current == 0xFF {
                s.bitIndex++
            }
        }
        s.bitIndex--
        res |= int((s.current >> s.bitIndex) & 1)
        n--
    }
    return
}

In this Go adaptation, I used `io.Reader` in place of `bytestream2`. While they aren't equivalent, the Go standard library doesn't provide a functional equivalent to `bytestream2`, so `io.Reader` has been used as a simple alternative for this illustrative piece of code. 

Depending on the specific needs of your Go program, you might find that this function requires changes before it could run. 

Remember: The primary purpose of this example was to illustrate the conversion of semantic intent from a C and a Go function, not to provide a like-for-like feature parity between the health_checker C program and a Go program. As always, pay close attention to your actual requirements to ensure any code you write, modify, or import meets them within your development environment. Be sure to debug and don't hesitate to ask for help when needed – Go is a massive ecosystem and new answers are being found for old problems each day.
