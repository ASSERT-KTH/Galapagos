You cannot directly convert this C code function to Go as 'avio_w8' is a function specifically provided by FFmpeg's libavformat library for writing data into an 'AVIOContext'. 'AVIOContext' is part of FFmpeg's way of handling I/O streaming, which lets FFmpeg to deal with data input and output in a uniform manner whether it comes from a network stream, a local file, or custom in-memory buffer.

However your requirement for ensuring semantically equivalent function in Go programming language, can be met, if the 'avio_w8' is understood to represent 'Write/Encode 8-bit'. Similarly, 'avio_wb32' suggests 'Write/Encode Big Endian 32 bit'. All this bytecode manipulation which is essential part of any multimedia processing can be done using "encoding/binary" package from Go's Standard Library. 

Here is the possible Go function but it assumes that s is some data storing structure that includes a writer capable of writing bytes.  

Go
import "encoding/binary"
import "io"

func AvioWb32(s io.Writer, val uint32) error {
    return binary.Write(s, binary.BigEndian, val)
}


The function writes a uint32 value into Writer using the big endian byte order. Function returns 'nil' on success and an 'error' occur in the process.

If the original function's signature has to be reflected where some byte-buffer like structure is used in `AVIOContext` in C, you can create a wrapper type and define a method on that type like this:

Go
type AVIOContext struct {
    Writer io.Writer
}

func (s *AVIOContext) AvioWb32(val uint32) error {
    return binary.Write(s.Writer, binary.BigEndian, val)
}

Again `AVIOContext` in this example is assumed to be structure (struct) containing a field `Writer` which takes `Write()` method from io.Writer Interface.
