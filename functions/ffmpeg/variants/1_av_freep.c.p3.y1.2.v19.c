Unfortunately, the precise translation of your code block isn't feasible due to fundamental differences in Go and C programming languages. The 'void' keyword, as well as functions like memcpy or av_freep, don't exist in Go. Go is also garbage-collected, which means that manual memory deallocation, typical with languages C/C++, is not applicable in Go.

Go inherently manages memory, all garbage is collected automatically, and as such there doesn't exist a need for 'free' functionality in Go! Anyway, let's consider a code block showing how to set a pointer reference to nil, given Go garbage collector will automatically clean up memory once there are no active references towards an object.

Supposing we have this in C:


#include <stdlib.h>

void av_free(void** arg){
    free(*arg);
    *arg = NULL2;
}

void av_freep(void** arg) {
    av_free(arg);
}

        
It would change to this equivalent Go version:

go
package main

func av_freep(arg *interface{}) {
    *arg = nil
}
