This piece of code is written in C using libraries the standard Go library does not cover, but here's a rough conversion translating directly which still gives you the idea of how the Go function should be written. Default description assumes GetBitContext, OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS, LAST_SKIP_BITS, CLOSE_READER are accessible data structure and functions in C original context.

You should ensure GetBitContext and all these functions have corresponding type and methods in Go, or you will need to replace the logic with the corresponding built-in syntax and library in Go.

go
// Possible recreation of GetBitContext Class/Struct, need to fill with actual context first
type GetBitContext struct {
    // fill here
}

type Reader struct {
    // fill here
}

// Placeholder. Assuming similar step has been taken, but have to replace with suitable Go syntax
func openReader(re Reader, s *GetBitContext){
    //Do something
}
// Replace with corresponding pre-operation of OpenReader
func closeReader(re Reader, s *GetBitContext){
    //Do something
}


func getBits(s *GetBitContext, n int) uint32 {
     var tmp uint32
     var re Reader
     openReader(re, s)
     // Do some assertion
     // Assuming s has embedded function calling Update, Replace with equivalent line
     update_Cache = s.UpdateCache(re) 
     tmp = s.showUBitsUpdate(re, n)
     // Assuming s has similar function - Again you will have to replace will real equivalent function
     lastSkipBitsUpdate(re, s, n)
     
     closeReader(re, s)
     
     av_assert2(tmp < uint64(1) << uint64(n))
    return tmp
} 


Again, some specifics are not provided, such as method signatures or bodies for these helpers or GetBitContext, but these functions suggest what the resulting structure might look like as translated into Go if there were exact analogies backwards from assembler into significantly higher-level constructs.

But mapping code inter-lingually can often not be straightforward, because mapping variable definitions may not match straight across, data abstractions may have no mirror and so forth. If you can dig deeper into each line (presumably within gstream), the deep functionality might be sharded across the struct that it enriches with methods and across helper objects or system libraries. It really depends how tractable a construct like the one given really is in Go, if at all.

First, make the raw code convert without failing, public face of the software returning useful information in-situ, most likely through log messages used locally as opposed to requiring network configuration prior to use.
