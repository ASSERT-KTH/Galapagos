Unfortunately, it is not directly possible to maintain the original function's signature since the C and Go languages operate differently. In order to work with pointer or return NULL in Go, we use the `error` return type. Additionally, memory allocation mechanisms (`malloc`, `calloc` etc.) in C don't have direct equivalents in Go where we simply use `make` or `new` for dynamic memory allocations. The code mentioned seems to be part of FFmpeg's AVUtils library and uses `av_mallocz` for allocating memory and setting it to zero which does not have a direct equivalent in Go. However, a somewhat functionally equivalent Go version using Go standards that multiplies two sizeT input and return a new zero-initialized slice could look something like this:

go
import "errors"

func avCalloc(nmemb, size int) ([]byte, error) {
    var result int
    result = nmemb * size
    if result < 0 {
        return nil, errors.New("size overflow")
    }
    
    data := make([]byte, result)
    return data, nil
}
