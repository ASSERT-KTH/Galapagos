The semantically equivalent function in Go cannot be created in direct translation from the C version due to some critical differences between C and Go's handling of variables and memory. 

The function `av_freep`, in C, works by taking a pointer, freeing the memory associated with that pointer, then setting that pointer to NULL. C Requires manual memory management. 

In Go’s garbage-collector based system, explicit freeing is never required. The garbage-collector takes care of the memory deallocation. Additionally, 'unsafe' equivalents of copying raw memory blocks (as intended by 'memcpy') do not translate well into Go's memory-safe paradigms that prevent arbitrary access to memory.

While `av_freep` style implementation or function signature won't have any meaningful equivalent implementation in Golang, a similar concept using slice in Go may look like this:

Go
func avFree(args *[]interface{}) {
    // Replace args with nil slice
    *args = nil
}


This function avFree receives a pointer to a slice of arbitrary data (`*[]interface{}`) and replaces it with a `nil` slice which will signal to Go's garbage collector that this can be cleaned up when time allows. Essentially resets or "frees" in some way (allowing GC to better decide on clearing the data). But it’s far from “Freeing a pointer, allowing block of arbitrary memory occupied by that data to be deallocated".

In essence, Golang with garbage collector-based system implies a significantly different function with vaguely catch-all implementation.
