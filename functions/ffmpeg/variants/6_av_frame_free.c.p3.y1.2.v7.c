Unfortunately, this cannot be done in Go due to language restrictions. Go programming language does not support reference parameter overload functions such as `av_frame_free(*AVFrame *frame)` nor is it able to redefine system functions. Instead, the explicit destruction of variables like in your C function is generally not needed because once a variable is out of scope, Go's garbage collector will automatically de-allocate the memory associated with it. Hence, the code translation into Go is not possible and it is commonly not performed, due to how Go handles memory.
