Go programming language does not support preprocessor directives, and it does not require explicitly freeing memory because it has a garbage collector that reclaims memory that is no longer in use.

However, if you need to create this function, it will be defined without the interior, as free memory in GolLang is under automatically garbage collectors control. Here there is no reasonable workaround. A simple version of the av_free function would look like this:

golang
func avFree(ptr unsafe.Pointer) {}


But remember, this function literally doesn't make any actions or effects.
