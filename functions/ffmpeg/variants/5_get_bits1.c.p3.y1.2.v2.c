Here is the Go code that follows the same logic and signature as the C program provided:

go
type GetBitContext struct {
	index                 uint32
	size_in_bits_plus8    uint32
	buffer                []byte
}

func get_bits1(s *GetBitContext) uint8 {
	index := s.index
	result := s.buffer[index >> 3]
	if isBitstreamReaderLE {
		result >>= index & 7
		result &= 1
	} else {
		result <<= index & 7
		result >>= 8 - 1
	}

	if !isUncheckedBitstreamReader {
		if s.index < s.size_in_bits_plus8 {
			index++
		}
	}

	s.index = index
	return uint8(result)
}

It has been assumed that `BITSTREAM_READER_LE` and `UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER` are simple boolean variables so I have replaced them with `isBitstreamReaderLE` and `isUncheckedBitstreamReader` respectively. 'byte', a uint8 data type in Go would be a equivalent `uint8_t` data type in C since i assume buffer to be an slice of these bytes. I have initialised these with generic arbitrary values, one might need to change those appropriately.
