The equivalent Go code could be realized in different patterns due to the flexible language characteristics of Go and the limitations when we port this C code - About its correctness, Go returns an error when a programming abnormal situation can be handled properly, unlike C, is taken into account in this Go equivalent version below:

go
package av

import (
    "errors"
)

type Frame struct {
    isFreed bool
}

func (f *Frame) Unref() {
    // ...method algorithm...
}

func Free(p **Frame) error {
    if p == nil || *p == nil {
        return errors.New("no frame to be freed")
    }

    if (*p).isFreed {
        return errors.New("the frame is already freed")
    }

    (*p).Unref()
    *p = nil

    return nil
}


This Go code snippet shows a `Free` function which is the equivalent to the `av_frame_free` from the C code shared. It checks whether the frame already happened `free` manage issue and called `Unref` which would call `av_frame_unref` in C before freeping the frame. If the freeing can not carry out properly due to required nil value with or the request of free up to an already freed `Frame` safely, appropriate error raised when needed. The Go non-nil error handling (circle inside), enables to boost usability of API user-safely application.
