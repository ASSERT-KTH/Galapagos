Unfortunately, Go does not provide a direct equivalent to this C code due to different handling of binary representation of numbers. More importantly, there's no corresponding `avio_w8` function (as in C) in Go because Go doesn't handle pointers to files or buffers in the same way C does.

However, you can do the similar operation using 'binary' and 'os' packages in Go. The rough equivalent of this code in Go, writing the 32bit unsigned int to an io.Writer (like a file), would be:

go
import (
    "encoding/binary"
    "io"
)

func avio_wb32(s io.Writer, val uint32) {
    binary.Write(s, binary.BigEndian, &val)
}


Please remember that you would need appropriate error handling according to your project standards. Please make sure the `io.Writer` (the `s` parameter) is a properly initialized writer to a file or a buffer.

Also notice the major change: instead of the pointer to `AVIOContext`, the function now accepts `io.Writer`. I've supposed that `AVIOContext` was some sort of structure to hold the buffer or file handle information; `io.Writer` is chosen as a function's parameter for that similar usage in Go.
