Since Go doesn't support function overloading or passing by pointer, we typically use method functions on a certain type (AVIOContext) to deal with method-like behavior. 

Also, the AVIOContext (or a similar type) should satisfy the `io.Writer` interface:

go
import "encoding/binary"

type AVIOContext struct {
    // Assuming AVIOContext struct fields here...
}

func (s *AVIOContext) WriteByte(c byte) error {
    // Assuming WriteByte method here...
}

func (s *AVIOContext) WriteUint32(c uint32) {
    s.WriteByte(byte(c >> 24))
    s.WriteByte(byte(c >> 16))
    s.WriteByte(byte(c >> 8))
    s.WriteByte(byte(c))
}


In this case the `WriteByte` method represents what `avio_w8` might stand for within the constraints of the Go language and with the need of realizing a "similar" behavior. The actual C-based `avio_w8` within this specific context would certainly depend upon internal constructs used within the `AVIOContext` and require rewriting if a direct translation is required. 

To actually perform the 'writing' task, `io.Writer` or an equivalent interface may be necessary to meet the constraints of the example. 

Since `binary.Write` wasn't used, for every write, the type should be cast to bytes specifically - accomplishing part of the original `avio_w8` function's work too.
