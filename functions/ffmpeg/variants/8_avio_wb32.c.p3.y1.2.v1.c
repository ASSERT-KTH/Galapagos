As Golang doesn't support bit-fields nor complex value types in a similar matter as void type used in C/C++, you would need to use bytes.Buffer objects or similar to reverse create bitwise equivalent function. That said, interactions method also varies in Go. Plus, Golang focusses on simplicity and readability. Dropping the context of the provided function as you haven't given the necessary context or definition for `AVIOContext` and assuming you want to create the following functionality:

1. Get an unsigned integer.
2. Create 4 bytes reprecentation, using shifting bit positions.
3. Write this 4-byte representation to somewhere.

Based on the given capability set, t Here's a simple function where an unsigned integer is turned into a 4-byte slice which can be written to a file or over the network:

go
import "encoding/binary"

func avioWrite(s *os.File, val uint32) {
    buf := make([]byte, 4)
    binary.BigEndian.PutUint32(buf, val)
    _, err := s.Write(buf)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}


Keeping in mind, the `os.File` write operation is used as a substitute wherein `os.File` can be replaced with writer as per suitable requirement. It however replaces the notion of `AVIOContext`.

Also, this implementation assumes `avio_w8()` writes a single byte to some kind of output stream (`s`). The `val` is then divided into four bytes, and each byte is written one-by-one from left to right (big endian). 

Certainly, just to ensure, fine your use-case and requirement to take this function equivalency feasibility fuurther.
