Go does not support function overloading or methods with *AVFrame type inputs equivalents in C. Therefore, this exact function cannot be directly translated into Go. However, the logic incorporated into this function follows a common garbage collection pattern in Go where memory and resources used are cleaned up at the end of the function call to prevent a memory leak.

The logic will look something like this:

type AVFrame struct {

   //All the members/types of struct from your original code
}

func av_frame_free_AVF(a **AVFrame) {

    if a != nil && *a != nil {

        av_frame_unref(*a)

        av_freep(a)

    }

}

The "**" before AVFrame is a syntax error in Go. In Go, every variable is by default initialized to zero of its type, so we don't need to pass pointers to pointers like in C.


You may want to implement those functions where the logic inside depends upon the actual use cases. Since we do not have an exact description of those functions changes need to be done according to real cases.

In Go, it is also uncommon to handle memory manually because garbage collector takes care of that. We don't have functions such as av_freep() because in Go, memory allocated to variables is automatically done and freeing of memory is handled by garbage collector. Proper way is just set variable to initial (zero) state (like nil for a pointer) and let garbage collector does the job.

FYI, Go is safe language and only functions in the 'unsafe' module can manipulate need to manipulate a point to a point. Recommended you must avoid it most harmful and is not compatible with Go's normal models: you could not present a compile time result and fail a random runtime, the performance won't improve much.
