Due to the differences in various features between the C and Go programming languages, it won't be possible to provide a semantically equivalent function for `av_log` in Go that maintains the exact same function signature.

This is largely due to two reasons:

1. Variadic Function Handling: In C, variadic functions are handled using va_arg (variable argument) macros, while, in Go, Variadic functions are handled by creating a variable number of arguments of a specific type. This means there's no direct equivalent in Go for `va_start`, `va_end` or `va_list`.

2. C Pointers: Go has pointers but they aren't used in the same way as they are in C. For example, Go has no equivalent to `void*` in C. You have to explicitly know what type of object you're working with in Go.

The closest resembling `av_log` function that could be written in Go would be something like this, where we assume `avcl` as of `interface{}` type, level as `int`, and fmt as `string`:

go
import "log"

func avLog(avcl interface{}, level int, fmt string, v ...interface{}) {
    log.Printf(fmt, v...)
}
 

Bear in mind that `interface{}` type is Go's equivalent for C's `void *`. This function wouldn't provide exactly the same functionality as the C function `av_log`. The exact equivalence depends on what `av_vlog` does and Go's `log.Printf` wouldn't act in the same way. Also, remember that this conversion isn't perfect and you must probably handle logging levels by yourself as it does not fit into the `Printf` equivalent in GO.
