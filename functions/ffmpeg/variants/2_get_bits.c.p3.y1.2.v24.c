As a language, Go doesn't have preprocessor instructions. Also, it doesn't have exceptions in traditional sense and hence, there is not corresponding conversion for `av_assert2`. Besides, the macros used (`OPEN_READER`, `UPDATE_CACHE`, `SHOW_UBITS`, `LAST_SKIP_BITS`, `CLOSE_READER`) are not present in Go anyway, so there's not one-to-one semantic conversion possible. However it's possible to create a template assuming that all necessary methods and types can be designed properly referring from the original code.

We assuming `GetBitContext` to be similar concept to C equivalent in Go. Here's basic structure what it can be in Go.
Go
type GetBitContext struct {
	// Assuming it's a kind "buffer",
    // but actual purpose & requirement depends on C code these are from.
	bits []byte // Relevant structure and type based on the original C code
	//Other necessary fields
}

To perform operations like `SHOW_UBITS`, `LAST_SKIP_BITS` etc., add methods specific to `GetBitContext` type. Like following or suits best based on the real code requirement:

Go
func (s *GetBitContext) showUBits(n int) uint {
	// Implementation based  on SHOW_UBITS's origial's implementation
    return resultVal
}


The content of anonymous functions is based on C macros. It's imitation. There may not be exist program semantic APIs (Add present in original C code - `OPEN_READER`, `SHOW_UBITS`, `LAST_SKIP_BITS`, `CLOSE_READER`) in Go standard libraries

Referencing from the original C code, a transforming implementation in terms of image can be like following

GO
//getBits translation from the C function get_bits()
func getBits(s *GetBitContext, n int) uint {
	if n < 1 || n > 25 {
		log.Panicln("n must be > 0 and <= 25")
	}

	tmpVar := s.showUBits(n)
	if tmpVar >= 1<<uint(n) {
		log.Panicln("tmp is not < (1 << n)")
	}

	//UPDATE_CACHE replacement
	s.cacheBits()

	//last skip bits replacement
	s.lastSkipBits(n)

	return tmpVar
}

Note: This translation depends heavily on my assumption that considering the Context of `GetBit` infers, where they're possibly some bit-level operations so it returns bits. Since context isn't clearly available in shared `get_bits()` code.
So in Go methodology it must be handled through corresponding Methods (`Methods`: Goâ€™s equivalent to Java `classes` concept ) resolving semantic of operations `OPEN_READER`, `SHOW_UBITS`, `LAST_SKIP_BITS`, and `CLOSE_READER`.

As clarified earlier, output from Go function is not completely precise and needs modification post know context of using Environmental Implementation, Still it closely semantically connects provided bit related operations by function in C. Comment's placed to aid clearly identifying related methods code will help mapping required alterations.
