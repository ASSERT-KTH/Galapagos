It would be impossible to maintain the original function's signature without redefining the `Jpeg2000EncoderContext` data structure in Go. However, other than the data structure, the function implementation on Go can still remain the same.

Here's how you would translate it to Go:

go
import "io"

type Jpeg2000EncoderContext struct {
  bit_index int
  buf       *io.Writer
}

func put_bits(s *Jpeg2000EncoderContext, val int, n int) {
  for n > 0 {
    if s.bit_index == 8 {
      var b = make([]byte, 1)
      n, _ = s.buf.Read(b)
      s.bit_index = 0
      if b[0] == 0xff {
        s.bit_index = 1
      }
      *s.buf = 0
    }
    *s.buf |= val << (7 - s.bit_index)
    s.bit_index++
    n--
  }
}


Please note that this does not handle error propagation which should be corrected by handling errors that come from `buf.Read`.

The Go version of the function maintains the original version logically. However, note that `s->buf` in your original code is treated as a pointer to bytes data, so it easily might not be in Go cause you are likely working with an `io.Writer`, or `bytes.Buffer`. It may have issues if not translated appropriately. We should refactor this large tangles interaction, and ideally these manipulations across places should be safely enclosed in methods of your own data structure `Jpeg2000EncoderContext` (especially write interaction). 

Thus in a real-life scenario, I really would also include a helper method for write actions on buffer (`s.buf`), checking errors in Go implementation than stated 'do not' on question.
