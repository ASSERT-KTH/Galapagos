In accordance with the rules and requirements specified in the prompt, the equivalent version of the function av_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size) in Go would not be straightforward. This is because semantics connected to dynamic memory allocation in Go are totally different from those in languages like C. 

In the C language code snippet shared, a calloc-like function is being implemented that uses a custom memory allocation function (Possibly `av_mallocz()`) which not only allocates the required amount of memory but also initializes it to zero. The allocation is possibly followed by a multiply-with-overflow check function which makes this complete code little bit more trickier.

On the other hand, Go has built-in methods for slice creation with initialization plus the garbage collector avoids troubles with deallocating memory while maintaining safety against memory leaks; and strategies for avoiding integer overflows are also baked into Go with its respective rules & conventions.

Having explained this a possible straightforward equivalent of such a function can be proposed in Go(+1.17)

golang

func callocate(nmemb, size int) []byte {
    // Not safe and no good translate an aritmetic overflow check in C
    if nmemb*size < 0 {
        return nil
    }
    return make([]byte, nmemb*size)
}



Note: C to Go function parameters using size_t has been implemented to int(s) considering this migration frequently practiced because these are native to Go and there is no direct equivalent to size_t.

Apart from this, an essentially undemanding phase would be translations between native data types / custom structs because potentially complexity giving tasks like manual memory allocation / deallocation / tracking are not done or done differently (allocation is automatic, deallocation is automatic/garbage collected, tracking is pointless).

Please do make note that conventions of each programming paradigms and languages do differ demographically so attention needs to paid towards making such inter-language translations/compilations that can just loose semantics along with unwanted introduction of potential issues.

So Thus, keeping semantics between the two languages precise and assuringly useful has lesser mapped process in them self and considering that going getting the converted snippet analyst reviewed would help assessing it authenticity / annotation is the work around to achieve the desired.
Lastly, having discussed seriousness around language caveats one should apply such conversions with risk and carefulness.
