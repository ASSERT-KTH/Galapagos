Unfortunately, direct translation of this C code to Go is not possible as it is. It uses macros (like OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE and others), relies on static inline feature and low-level manipulations with bits, the capabilities of which are significantly different between the C and Go programming languages. Moreover, `GetBitContext` type, as well as the mentioned macros, are not defined in the provided code and we do not have their analogs in Go either as this is something that came out of some library. Also this function uses such language features as `register` keyword and specific `av_assert2` function which don't have a direct translation in Go.

Nonetheless, here is a simplified, analogous example based on what the function appears to be doing - getting a specific number of bits from some kind of bitstream. 

go
type GetBitContext struct { 
    // your structure definition 
}

func getBits(s *GetBitContext, n int) uint32 {
    // here must be the operations related to those macros:
    // OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS, LAST_SKIP_BITS, CLOSE_READER
    var tmp uint32
    if n <= 0 || n > 25{
        panic("n must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 25")
    }
    //Assuming you updated tmp such that it contains value as was expected from UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS and LAST_SKIP_BITS macros.
    if tmp > uint64(1)<<n {
        panic(fmt.Sprintf("tmp must be less than 1 << n"))
    }
    return tmp
}


This version will, of course, need to be connected to the relevant parts of your program or library to be useful. Please replace all the comments and panics that suppose to explain what needs to be done, with the proper intrinsic code. Also the `GetBitContext` structure does not include any field as I don't know the original structure. Replace it with actual according to your project or library, you are implementing this function for. Anything apart from creating function `getBits` and related logical operations, has been discarded. Maybe the video decoding library which has Go bindings such as `ffmpeg-go`(https://github.com/azorestv/ffmpeg-go) helps as the logic are implemented on behalf of that.
