It's a bit tricky as you are asking a mapping from C to Go for a more complex function that involves mutable state of a growing structure (a "buf" that can be added onto, bit by bit, modifying its tail as more bits are added). The mutable state is inferred by observing that `bit_index` can roll, and `buf` grows. We hardcode support for only one byte beyond capacity (7 occupancy). This indeed closely mimics analogous Go byte/bit chores with `binary.Write` in Go: pushing collection boundaries automatically as more is added.

In any case, here's a Go reference implementation attempt.

go
type Jpeg2000EncoderContext struct {
	buf        *[]byte
	bitIndex   uint
	val        uint
	n          uint
	nextExists bool
	next       byte
}

func (s *Jpeg2000EncoderContext) putBits(val int, n int) { 
    var value uint = uint(val)
    for i := uint(n); i > 0; i-- {
        if s.bitIndex == 8 {
            s.bitIndex = 0
            if s.nextExists && s.next == 0xff {
                s.bitIndex = 1
            }
            s.nextExists = true
            s.next = 0x0            
            
        }
        s.next |= (value << (7 - s.bitIndex)) & 0xFF
        value >>= 1
        s.bitIndex++
            
        if s.bitIndex == 8 {
            (*s.buf) = append((*s.buf), s.next)
            s.bitIndex = 0
            s.nextExists = false

        }	    
    }
}

Please note that you have to create `buf` (a byte slice) before using the putBits function.
