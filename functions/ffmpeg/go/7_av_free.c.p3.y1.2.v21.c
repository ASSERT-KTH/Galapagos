In Go, you do not have to manually manage memory because the built-in garbage collector, which deallocates memory once the object it reserved is no longer in use, automatically wipes memory for you once there is nothing left referencing that memory. This basically means you don't have the capacity to free a pointed section of memory in Go. You may skip it for Go then because golang has automatic memory (heap) management.
