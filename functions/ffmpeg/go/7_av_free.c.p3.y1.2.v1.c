Go does not have a preprocessor like C to conditionally compile code depending on whether a certain feature is available or not. Also, memory management is handled automatically by Go's garbage collector, so there is no direct equivalent to the `free` function in C. Therefore, same exact semantic cannot be reproduced in Go as the original C function.

It's important to note that it generally isn't necessary for the programmer to manually deallocate memory in Go. However, if you are interfacing with C code using CGo and you need to free memory allocated in C, you can use `C.free` from the `C` package:

go
// #include <stdlib.h>
import "C"

func av_free(ptr *C.void) {
        C.free(ptr)
}


Do this only if you are absolutely sure about what you are doing. It is likely that Go's garbage collector won't manage this memory for you once you explicitly tell CGo to deallocate it.

Here are two general rules:
* Memory you allocated in C should be freed by C code.
* Memory you allocated in Go should be 
freed by Go (garbage collector). 

Any help needed, you should refer to guidelines on memory management policy documentation or in Golang/CGo.
