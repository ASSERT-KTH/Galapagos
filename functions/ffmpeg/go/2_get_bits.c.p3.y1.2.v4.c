I'm sorry, but it seems there are mistakes in the request. The code provided does not match directly with Go programming language because these macros(OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS, LAST_SKIP_BITS, CLOSE_READER) and struct(GetBitContext) have been developed specifically for the C program, not for Go. Also, Go doesn't use statements like "assert". To provide a high-level translation without knowning how this struct built and macros work would potentially lead to function errors when converted into a Go function.
