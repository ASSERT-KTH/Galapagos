It is impossible to create a semantically equivalent version of this function in Go. The C code uses variadic arguments and the vsprintf function from the stdarg library to handle them. In contrast, Go handles variadic arguments differently.

The va_start, va_end usage is typical in C, but is not directly translatable in Go. In Go, we cannot perform these actions due to the absence of risky pointer manipulation as it exists in languages like C. Same with vfunc styles, there simply aren't variadic function handling like the C way. 

While, in Go, we use `...` to denote variadic parameters, but they work much more safely than the equivalent in C. Data to/from such parameters are marshalled into a slice (array). 

However, this is more like a sketch about how the function might look; regardless that it could work normally.

import "fmt"

func avLog(avcl interface{}, level int, format string, v ...interface{}) {
    str := fmt.Sprintf(format, v...)
    fmt.Println(str)
}

This Go function assumes that the original C function outputs a string formatted according to a format string and a variable number of arguments. Note that error checking has been omitted for brevity.
