Please Note: In the absence of definite Context `Jpeg2000EncoderContext` priorly initially defined variable, my usage will hypothetically mention Go Struct which will hypothetically structure the given signature, and must update appropriately accordingly on actual usage.

go
type Jpeg2000EncoderContext struct { 
    bitIndex int
    buf *[]byte 
}

func putBits(s *Jpeg2000EncoderContext, val int, n int) {
    for n > 0 {
        if s.bitIndex == 8 {
            if (*s.buf)[0] == 0xff {
                s.bitIndex = 1
            } else {
                s.bitIndex = 0
            }
            newBuf := make([]byte, len(*s.buf)+1)
            copy(newBuf, *s.buf)
            newBuf[len(newBuf)-1] = 0
            s.buf = &newBuf
        }
        (*s.buf)[s.bitIndex] |= byte(val << (7 - s.bitIndex))
        s.bitIndex++
        n--
    }
}


Keep in mind that C has different short-circuiting and pointer dereferencing from Go, so we cannot directly translate C to Go. In practical scenarios you would typically use the Go standard library for handling growing slices and output buffers instead of manual low-level bit manipulation and buffer resizing here. This just serves as the semantic equivalent understanding translation without those features taking into consideration.
