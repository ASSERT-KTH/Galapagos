In Go, it's difficult to translate certain aspects of the code provided due to limited access to low-level constructs compared to C. Here's a high-level interface interpretation based on the understanding of the function.

Dependencies like the C-macros (OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE, CLOSE_READER, etc.), and typedefs were not included since they are not directly convertible to Go and require the constructs surrounding them to be completely translated. Please adapt the below go code according to your low-level constructs and dependencies used inside those macro functions.

In Go, error checks are performed using if conditions to ensure the equivalent of av_assert2.

Go
func getBits(s *GetBitContext, n int) (uint64, error) {

    var tmp uint64

    // Equivalent for `OPEN_READER(re, s);` macro in C
    // Some code here ...
        
    if !(n > 0 && n<= 25) {
        return 0, errors.New("n is out of acceptable range") 
    }

    // Equivalent for `UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);` macro in C
    // Some code here ...
   
    // Equivalent for `tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);` function in C
    // Let's assume you had Go function whose purpose matches with `SHOW_UBITS` function in c.
    tmp = showUbits(s, n)

    // Equivalent for `LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);` macro in C
    // Some code here ...
   

    // Equivalent for `CLOSE_READER(re, s);` macro in C
    // Some code here ...
   
    if tmp >= 1<<n {
        return 0, errors.New("Invalid result")
    }

    return tmp, nil
} 


**Please NOTE:** C's inlined functions and macro might lead to better inlining and thus performance in some cases. In Go, advanced compiler optimizations such as inlining functions are automatically handled by the compiler and we do not have much control over it. Therefore, it’s better to keep Go code idiomatic and not focus on optimizations until there’s a known performance issue. Also, the errors used here are samples, please use suitable error handling as per your application.
