Go does not have preprocessor directives as in C. However, aligned memory operations are not usually needed in most Go programming scenarios because Go handles memory allocation and deallocation behind the scene. Hence, there is no direct equivalent to `_aligned_free` function too. The regular Go equivalent of `free()` would be to simply let Go's garbage collector take care of freeing the memory. But for the purpose of code intentions similarity, you might schedule to manually release or set memory reference as being unused using a somewhat similar structure as follows:

go
func avFree(ptr *unsafe.Pointer) {
	*ptr = nil
}

Please note that since it's not idiomatic in go to manually free memory, usage in actual go applications may lead to unexpected behaviour. It's best to allow Go's garbage collector manage memory as it's more safe and reliable.
