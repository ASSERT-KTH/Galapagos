Unfortunately, it is impossible to maintain the original function's signature in this case. A Jpeg2000DecoderContext type is defined in userland C, where Go lacks equivalent types for bit_index and g (assuming it's a pointer to a GetByteContext for FFmpeg, as bytestream2_get_byte suggest), we cannot clearly make this conversion easily. Positions handling vars like bit_index doesnâ€™t have a direct equivalent in Golang too.

However if we have equivalent in golang definied already and focusing on bitwise operation, direct structs manipulation and variables read/write operations we can translate as follows, where as Jpeg2000DecoderContext already provides methods equivalent to above operations like getting a byte, peeking a byte:

golang
type Jpeg2000DecoderContext struct {
	bitIndex int
	g        GetByteContext
}

func (s *Jpeg2000DecoderContext) getBits(n int) int {
	res := 0
	for n--; n >= 0; n-- {
		res <<= 1
		if s.bitIndex == 0 {
			if s.g.getByte() != 0xFF {
				s.bitIndex = 8
			} else {
				s.bitIndex = 7
			}
		}
		s.bitIndex--
		res |= (s.g.peekByte() >> s.bitIndex) & 1
	}
	return res
}


This makes the assumption that affecting structs behavior of s are happening via already defined methods specifically provided by Jpeg2000DecoderContext struct, 'g' is being treated as providing bytewise reading ability and bit_index specifies the current position in the buffer being analyzed.
