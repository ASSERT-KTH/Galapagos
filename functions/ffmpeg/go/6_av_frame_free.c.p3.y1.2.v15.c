In Go, pointers are handled quite differently compared to C. And considering how Go handles data, the task of un referencing frames like in C is not typical. But in Go, this can be accomplished through use of interfaces. Here is an implementation assuming that AVFrame and its associated methods are defined:

go
func AvFrameFree(frame **AVFrame) {
    if frame == nil || *frame == nil {
        return
    }
    
    (*frame).Unref()
    *frame = nil
}


Before using the above function, you must ensure that you structure AVFrame as an interface (or preferably structs with defined methods) and write logic of `Unref()`. The implementation for freeing pointer relies heavily on Go's garbage collector which means you need not free the memory explicitly unlike in C. Once an object has no references, Go's garbage collector will automatically free its associated memory.
