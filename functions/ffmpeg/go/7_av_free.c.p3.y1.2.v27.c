Go has a garbage collector and does not require manual memory management like C does, therefore a direct equivalent of av_free is difficult to produce, as there is no equivalent to free(). Still here is a basic idea of how the function might look if such functionality did exist.

go
// This function won't work on the latest versions of Go as Golang is garbage collected (memory is managed by go-lang runtime)
func avFree(ptr unsafe.Pointer) {
	val := uintptr(ptr)
	
	//Go doesn't have a Preprocessor`
	//garbage collecting a specific memory
	runtime.GC()

	// dereferencing the pointer hence writing nothing into it.
	*(**int)(unsafe.Pointer(val)) = 0
	
	// You cannot do anything more like Câ€™s free() function without damaging structure of Go memory management
}


Please be aware that above is putting zero values in the pointer referenced locations. We must not manually free a memory in `Go` using `unsafe` package as `Go` runtime garbage collector automatically handle this kind of task in efficient way.
