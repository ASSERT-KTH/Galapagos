As Go lang does not return NULL on errors like C does, semantically equivalent code can't be achieved. Additionally, the "av_" functions are part of FFmpeg's library written in C, and thus they are irrelevant in Go's context, as well as their specifications might not be exact due to their flexibility dealing with different data types. In our case, we respond with idiomatic Go code where we handle the potential errors, but note that this is different from the original code:

The following code is an analogous implementation of the function which foregoes the use of FFmepg functions:

go
import (
	"errors"
)

func av_calloc(nmemb int, size int) ([]byte, error) {
    if nmemb * size < 0 {
		return nil, errors.New("wrong nmemb / size")
	}
	return make([]byte, nmemb*size), nil
}


Above implementation initializes a zeroed-out buffer, created a 'new' pointer having same purpose as "av_mallocz", but doesn't apply an analogous adjustment for size_mult. Sizes (nmemb or size) being lower than 0, are deemed inappropriate hence an error message is returned. It is important to note that the information available is inferred from to size_multâ€™s function prototype and equivalent Go's gonna be distinct because C's ease of pointer manipulation causes it in this specific usage case to perform more defensive checks (Multiplication could wrap).
