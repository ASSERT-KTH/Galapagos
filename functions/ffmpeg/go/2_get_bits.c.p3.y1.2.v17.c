Please note that translation of the C code to Go is a not a straightforward process due to the absence of certain features used in the C code, e.g. macros, registers, and bit-packing manipulations. Therefore, a direct 1:1 translation of the function might not be possible. The complexity of semantically equivalent function in Go increases because a few functionalities of macros are needed to be implemented which in Go can be handled in different ways. In addition, the 'GetBitContext' data structure is not clearly defined. Nevertheless, following is an assumed running function in Go which gives an idea.

go
import "math"

func getBits(s *GetBitContext, n int) uint {

    // Assumes that GetBitContext has a BitReader buffer
    if n < 1 || n > 25 {
        panic("n should be within 1..25 range")
    }

    tmp := s.Bits.Read(n)

    if tmp >= math.Pow(2,n) {
        panic("Unexpected integer value read; possibly due to incorrect bits parameter")
    }

    return tmp
}
