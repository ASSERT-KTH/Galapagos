Sorry, but we can't maintain the original function's signature in Go because Go doesn't support referencing pointer structures like in C. However, the same behaviour can be achieved by embedding the function as methods of the equivalent class for Jpeg2000EncoderContext. See the translation below:

go
type Jpeg2000EncoderContext struct {
	bitIndex int
	buf      *[]byte
}

func (s *Jpeg2000EncoderContext) putBits(val int, n int) { // TODO: optimize
	for n > 0 {
		if s.bitIndex == 8 {
			s.bitIndex = int((*s.buf)[0] == 0xff)
			*s.buf = append((*s.buf), 0)
		}
		(*s.buf)[len(*s.buf)-1] |= byte(val << (7 - s.bitIndex))
		s.bitIndex++
		n--
	}
}


This code assumes `buf` is a slice of bytes (`[]byte`) and does memory manipulation accordingly. We use `val << (7 - s.bitIndex)` where it casts the `val` to `byte` to match the `bytearray` manipulation. After writing, it increments the bitIndex for the next operation and decreases n until n drops to 0. The context(`s`) must be a pointer because it modifies the context. Please adjust the `[]byte` according to your real `buf` data structure.
