The given C function contains calls to functions and operations that are specific to the FFmpeg video processing library and the C programming language and cannot be directly translated to Go. However, a semantically equivalent version of this function would handle frame deallocation and cleaning in the way that the original source does for AVFrames. Without these dependencies or a structure with similar methods, the exact functionality of the original code might not be replicated in Go. The consistent Go code should resemble this.

Go
func av_frame_free(frame **AVFrame) {
    if frame == nil || *frame == nil {
        return
    }

    (*frame).Unref()
    *frame = nil
}


However, a thing to be noted is that in Go, garbage collection automatically cleans up the unused memory which may include nil marked objects i.e unused frames, hence manual unref and free operation might not be simply necessary.
