Unfortunately, Go does not directly support bit-level I/O operations like this out of the box. Furthermore, direct memory access represented by data pointer, like in C, doesn't exist in pure Go. Below is a general structure you might use, assuming that `s *Jpeg2000DecoderContext` is a struct with "bit_index" (`s.bitIndex`) and "g" (`s.g`) accessible, where 'g' would be equivalent to a 'Reader', 'ReadByte()' and 'Peek()' methods.

Note that there is no exact version of bytestream2 found in the common Go libraries as it's specific to libavutil in C. For a functionally equivalent Go version, you would typically design 'bit buffers'. A higher level approach could involve adaptation of higher level libraries such as image/jpeg in the Go standard library, as it hides a lot of this low level bit-twiddling because it's less necessary with garbage-collected memory safe languages.

go
type Jpeg2000DecoderContext struct{
	BitIndex uint8
	G        Reader // assuming G is equivalent to a Reader
}

func getBits(s *Jpeg2000DecoderContext, n int) int {
	res := 0
	n--

	for n >= 0 {
		res <<= 1
		if s.BitIndex == 0 {
			byte, err := s.G.ReadByte()
			if err != nil {
				// Handle Error
			}
			s.BitIndex = 7 + uint8(byte != 0xFF)
		}
		s.BitIndex--
		peekedByte, err := s.G.Peek(1)
		if err != nil {
			// Handle Error
		}
		res |= int(peekedByte[0]>>s.BitIndex) & 1

		n--
	}
	return res
}


Remember that in case a byte-buffer does not have enough unread bytes, ReadByte() and Peek() typically return 'EOF' error which needs to be handled appropriately in the Go code block.
