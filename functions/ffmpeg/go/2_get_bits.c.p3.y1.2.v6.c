In the Go programming language, this code might look something like this:

go
func GetBits(s *GetBitContext, n int) uint {
	var tmp uint
	
	OpenReader(&re, s)
	if n <= 0 || n > 25 {
		panic("n should be >0 and <=25")
	}
	UpdateCache(&re, s)
	tmp = ShowUBits(&re, s, n)
	LastSkipBits(&re, s, n)
	CloseReader(&re, s)
	if tmp >= uint(1)<<n {
		panic("tmp should be < 1<<n")
	}
	return tmp
}


Note that Go does not have an inbuilt assert function like the `av_assert2` found in the C code. Instead, panic/recover paradigm is used. Since the functions referenced in the given C sample (OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS, LAST_SKIP_BITS, CLOSE_READER) don't exist in Go, we assumed that they can be represented with corresponding function calls in their capitalized form.

'-inline-' keyword in the C code is used for compiler optimization, which is used when we would prefer function to be inserted at each point of the function call to reduce the overhead of the function call. Unlike C, Inlining is automatically done by Go compiler.
