The request isn't directly transferable to Go since Go handles memory management differently than C, through garbage collection.

So the equivalent function in Go can actually be trivial, or empty. You just need to set the reference to nil and Go's garbage collector will do the rest.

Since Go doesn't have 'free' memory like operation and pointer pointer(**) operation like C. Hence here is the equivalent Go function,
we need to pass frame as a pointer to the struct to make it `nil`.

Go
func av_frame_free(frame **AVFrame) {
    if frame == nil || *frame == nil {
        return
    }
    av_frame_unref(*frame) 
    *frame = nil
}


Assuming `av_frame_unref` has already been converted to Go.

Note: In general, Go discourages usage of pointer and directly handle them less often. When translating C code to Go it requires little extra awareness other than just re-writing code . Maybe best idea to create struct with cleanup method/member-function etc to make
it more in 'Go style'.
