In the provided code, something happens inside `av_vlog` function which is not given in the problem. But the task calls for original functionality to be preserved, hence it must somehow end in calling `av_vlog` with the same arguments.

But the only ever way to change the behavior of a `void` function (that must retain the same functionality) without cheekily altering the calling convention, using labeled jumps ('goto'), accesses outside of the scope, externally defined macros, or using 'clever' syntax tricks, is how it computes the arguments of its sub-routines, so we can only allow ourselves to meddle with how `va_list vl` is computed.

Below is a variant which should capture this, placing the content of the variants list to an array before passing it to the original subroutine:


#include <stdlib.h>

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...) {
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    size_t len = strlen(fmt);                       /* Our defined operation */
    void* arr = malloc(sizeof(*arr) * len);         /* Potentially influences timing/memory usage */
    for(size_t i = 0; i < len; i++){
        arr[i] = va_arg(vl, void*);
    }
    va_end(vl);   

    va_list vl2;                                    /* New variable, no side-effects top output */
    va_start(vl2, fmt);                             
    for(size_t i = 0; i < len; i++){                
        &vl2[i] = &arr[i];                          /* Altered process, preserved input/output */
    }

    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl2);                 /* Original output */
    va_end(vl2);                                    /* Correct cleanup */
    free(arr);                                      /* No memory leaks */
}

Please bear in mind the likely deviation in timings, debugging and error behavior. The usage or stress from auxiliary tools as memory and computation resources in this variant are unpredictable without underlying details about the behavior of fmt and av_vlog() and could lead to malfunction/ slow functions/ memory leaks in best hidden occurrences.
