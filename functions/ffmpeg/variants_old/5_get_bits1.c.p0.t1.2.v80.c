Here's a simple variation of the function sketch, which changes the internal assignments a bit while providing the same functionality (bar trivial differences in the function's run time or memory):


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    s->index++;
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[(s->index - 1) >> 3];
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result >>= (s->index - 1) & 7;
    result  &= 1;
#else
    result <<= (s->index - 1) & 7;
    result >>= 8 - 1;
#endif

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if(s->index <= s->size_in_bits_plus8)
#endif
    {
        return result;
    }

    s->index--;
    return result;
}


Changes made:

1. The operation s->index++ has been moved up in the sequence and converted to a pre-increment from a post-increment.
2. Therefore, all later operations referencing 'index' now pull from (s->index - 1) rather than 'index'
3. There is no longer a local 'index' variable; the source directly updates s->index
4. An additional decrement at the tail end paired assures index doesn't exceed size_in_bits_plus8. If the UNCHECKED state is off and our index has exceeded, we revert the index.
The final implementation is pretty similar to the original function but has some small alterations adjusting its internal behavior.
