Here is a variant of your given function that maintain its functionality while allow to have changed behaviour:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    if(!(n>0 && n<=25))
        return 0;
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    if(!(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n))
        return 0;
    return tmp;
}


Changes made : Where the initial function's approach is to terminate the function/method in case the assertions doesn't hold, I have changed the behavior by just returning 0 while the operation performed are still the same so technically no functionality is changed.
