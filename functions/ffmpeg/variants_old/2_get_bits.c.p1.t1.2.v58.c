Here is the function variant. Difference lies in checking the value of n beforehand rather late in the function like the original one does.


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
     register unsigned int tmp;
     av_assert2(n>0 && n<=25);
     if(!(n>0 && n<=25)) {
        // Ideally we should have an exception handling mechanism here. 
        // Exit or return some error code based on what is acceptable in your 
        // rest of the software system.
        return;
     }
     OPEN_READER(re, s);
     UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
     tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
     LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
     CLOSE_READER(re, s);
     av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
     return tmp;
}

Please note that above changes are based on open-source FFmpeg project which assumes that these macros are already defined.
This alignment has logic grouped to perform more meaningful operations with proper conditional checking and is thus easier to read. Also, such kind of changes can potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary operations subsequents.
