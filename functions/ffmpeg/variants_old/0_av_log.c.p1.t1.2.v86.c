Sure, here is a program variant that preserves the original functionality but also adds an extra condition that allows it to handle a special logging level.


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    // Define a special logging level
    const int SPECIAL_LOG_LEVEL = 100;
    
    // For normal levels we just pass the arguments through as before
    if(level != SPECIAL_LOG_LEVEL) 
    {
        va_list vl;
        va_start(vl, fmt);
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
        va_end(vl);
    }
    // For the special level we prepend a message before passing the arguments through
    else 
    {
        va_list vl;
        va_start(vl, fmt);
        av_vlog(avcl, level, "[SPECIAL LOG] %s", fmt, vl);
        va_end(vl);
    }
}


In this change, if the level is not the special logging level, the function performs exactly as it did originally. However, when the level is the special logging level, we prepend a string `"[SPECIAL LOG] "` to the formatting string. This modified string, along with the resulting formatting args, are then passed to `av_vlog()` as before. Note that `...` and `va_start()` allows this function to handle variable numbers of arguments, so prepending a string like this is compatible with the original function's behavior.
