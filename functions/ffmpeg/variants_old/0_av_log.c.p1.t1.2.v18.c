While your request seemed to be focused on adding content and changing the behavior in a meaningful way, please note that that might not be entirely feasible here as the function you've provided uses variadic arguments and further passes these to another function `av_vlog`. 

Below is an updated version where we've added a simple conditional that could potentially change the behavior:


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);

    /* Change behavior based on level */
    if (level > 0) 
    {
       level = level * 2;
    }
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
}


In this version of the function, I've added a conditional to change `level` if it's greater than 0. Without further context it's hard to know how to change the function in a significant and meaningful manner. Nonetheless, above is a basic way how you could in theory change the behavior of the function while not affecting its signature and its positional functionality.
