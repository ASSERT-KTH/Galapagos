One possible program variant could manipulate the function by shifting the internal process order a little, while still providing the same ultimate functionality. 


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n){
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(n>0 && n<=25);
    register unsigned int tmp;

    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);

    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    return tmp;
}

What has happened here is that I did a slight trick and changed order of temp assignment and skip bits line. The feasibility of this change might depend upon underlying definitions of macro functions 'LAST_SKIP_BITS' and 'SHOW_UBITS'. This modification should still provide the original functionality under reasonable assumptions about these macros. It is important to validate this variant with proper test cases before adopting it as drop-in replacement.
