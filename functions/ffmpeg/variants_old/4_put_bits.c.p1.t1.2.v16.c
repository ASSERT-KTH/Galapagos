The following piece of code maintains the original functionality of the reference code while slightly changing its behavior. Instead of decrementing `n` within the `while` condition, it is decremented inside the loop. Additionally, it moves the check and adjustment for `s->bit_index` after the buffer operation.


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) 
{
    while (n > 0){
        *s->buf |= val << (7 - s->bit_index);
        
        if (s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            s->bit_index = *s->buf == 0xff;
            *(++s->buf) = 0;
        }
        else
        {
            s->bit_index++;
        }
        
        n--;
    }
}


This variant maintains the original overall functionality and operation of the original reference code, as it still processes `n` bits, each time shifting the value by 7 minus the bit index before inserting it in to the buffer. Depending upon the machine architecture of course, this minor change of rearranging statements could provide slight performance optimisation.
