Here is a program variant that changes the behavior in terms of program flow with the help of an extra local variable. It implements a for loop instead of a while, and it maintains the original functionality i.e., placing 'n' bits of 'val' starting from least significant bit into place determined by 'bit_index'.

Code:

static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) 
{
    int temp = n;

    for (; temp > 0; temp--) 
    {
        if (s->bit_index == 8) 
        {
            s->bit_index = *s->buf == 0xff;
            *(++s->buf) = 0;
        }
        *s->buf |= val << (7 - s->bit_index++);
    }
}

This implementation follows the original functionality, and control flow has only been changed to provide variety. No additional helper functions were created to maintain its original form and signature.
