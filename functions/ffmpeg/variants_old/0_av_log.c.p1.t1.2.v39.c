You can change the behavior of the original function while maintaining its original functionality by adding additional code, like error checks or logging:


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    if (!avcl || !fmt) {
        return;
    }

    if (level < 0) {
        level = 0;
    }

    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
   
    if (av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl) != 0) {   // assuming av_vlog returns a value
       fprintf(stderr, "An error occurred in the av_vlog function\n");
    }

    va_end(vl);

    if (level > 5) {
        printf("High level passed in, please verify\n");
    }
}


Please note that how "av_vlog" function uses its parameters isn't specified in original question and might change how conditions will be applied in our modified function. In our new implementation we add checks for the parameters received by “av_log” assuming we don’t want to work with NULL values for “avcl” and “fmt”.

We add checks for level, and assume it’s an undesired value if negative. We check for error returned by av_vlog() function. After completing all logging we check if the provided level is considered high, assuming that 5 is higher level cutoff value in this case. 

Please remember to make sure this modification is true to your code specifics. Instructions are provided assuming hypothetical behavior of variables and inner methods.
