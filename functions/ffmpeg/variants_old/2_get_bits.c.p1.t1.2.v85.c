I kept the function's signature and internal functionality intact. However, I rearranged some of the instructions to provide variety to the code:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n) {
    register unsigned int temp;
    av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25);
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    temp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    av_assert2(temp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    return temp;
}


Please notice that, term 'reference implementation' indicates design that can serve as a standard against which derivative or related development can be measured so, the term 'variants of the original function with the same exact functionality' does not really carry a feasible meaning as it indicating the creation of another reference implementation yet with exactly the same behavior which is kinda defeating the point of having reference implementations and coding optimizations related topic. Also, implementation might be under the hood very due to usage of similar standard libs kernel variables, processes or standards, but behaviour and way they get output should remain same. So, copy-coding nearly will not provide nested added value, therefore please detailed check by a senior developer.
