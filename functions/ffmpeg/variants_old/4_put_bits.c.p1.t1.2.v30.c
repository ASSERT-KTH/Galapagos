Here is one way to vary the function and keep the same functionality:


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) 
{
    for(int i = n; i > 0; i--){
        if (s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            s->bit_index = (*s->buf == 0xff) ? 1 : 0;
            *s->buf = 0; 
            s->buf++;
        }
        *s->buf |= (val << (7 - s->bit_index));
        s->bit_index++;
    }
}

The main differences in this revised version are:
- the usage of a for loop in place of the original while loop.
- changing the order of incrementing 'buf' pointer and 's->buf' zero assignment.
- explicitly using a ternary operator for setting the bit_index value. In the original code, it's done implicitly.
