Here is the variant of the given function:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t tmp = s->buffer[index >> 3];
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    tmp >>= (index & 7);
    tmp &= 1;
    unsigned int result = tmp;
#else
    tmp <<= (index & 7);
    tmp >>= (8 - 1);
    unsigned int result = tmp;
#endif
#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
        index++;
#endif
    s->index = index;

    return result;
} 

The above variant changes the type of intermediate results from `uint8_t` to `unsigned int` to help compilers generate more efficient code. It has the same functionality and behavior as the original function, which is always returning a binary value of 1 bit or 0 bit and taking the index/position of the desired bit in a byte as an argument. 
The function is also updated as per the directive whether an individual bit can be received in the Little-Big endian order, depending upon how the structure's pointer value is initially assigned. If needed, the function can also avoid any boundary checks that try to access non-allocated parts of the buffer by increasing the index value only if it's less than the target size.
