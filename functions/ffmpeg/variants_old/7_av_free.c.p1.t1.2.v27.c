Here is a variant of the code that maintains the functionality of the free operation, but adds checks to ensure that the argument isn't a NULL pointer before attempting to free it. In C, free operation on a Null pointer is a perfectly valid operation, it has no effect. But this check is introduced keeping in mind the best practices if the function is used in bigger programs. Also, it logs a message if a null pointer was attempted to be freed which can be helpful from the debugging perspective.


#include <stdio.h>

void av_free(void *ptr)
{
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Warning: Attempted to free a null pointer\n");
        return;
    }

#if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
    _aligned_free(ptr);
#else
    free(ptr);
#endif
    ptr = NULL; // even though this isn't necessary in this function specifically as the changes are not reflected outside, this can be a good safety abstraction in a potential larger program with more complexity to prevent dereferencing in the future of the freed pointer
}
