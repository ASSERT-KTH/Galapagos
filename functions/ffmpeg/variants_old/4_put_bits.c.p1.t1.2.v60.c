While there might be various possible strategies to change the behaviour of the function while maintaining its original functionality, one option could be to change the internal structure of the function - for instance, implementing a for loop instead of while and  using bit-wise operation to simplify some checks:


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) 
{
    int i;
    
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        s->bit_index = s->bit_index & (*s->buf == 0xff); /* Change boolean and assignation to bitwise ops */
        *(s->buf + ((s->bit_index == 8) ? (++s->bit_index,1):0)) = 0; /* Convert to ternary action assignment */
        *s->buf |= (val << (7 - s->bit_index++)) & ~*s->buf; /* Shift and bitwise and operation */
    }
}

This variant still keeps the function's initial functionality, output and logic. However, adds more verbose and different approach handling the bit manipulation and iterating the bit index.
Please do consider, `bitwise` operation over boolean can affects programming readability and the compilers nowadays are powerful enough to optimize binary & boolean operations.
