}

In this revised function, we've exchanged the placement of the LAST_SKIP_BITS() function and CLOSE_READER(). Without context specific details, it's only based under general assumptions that this change will theoretically not impact any expected outputs or side-effects. However, depending on the broader code context this manipulation could affect application or results. It's important to verify and do diligence testing while altering optimized code execution.
