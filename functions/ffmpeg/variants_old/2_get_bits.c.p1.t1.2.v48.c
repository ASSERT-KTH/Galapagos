Here's a program variant maintaining original functionality while changing the behaviour:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    unsigned int r;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25);
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);

    r = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    
    if (n == 0)
    {
        CLOSE_READER(re, s);
        av_assert0(r < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    }
    else
    {
        LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
        CLOSE_READER(re, s);
        av_assert2(r < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    }
    
    return r;
}


In the above code:

Initial coding style is kept consistent with its internal condition, which triggers different logic when n is equal to zero. The purpose of conducting this modification is to apply more diversified code logic, maintaining its original functionality. The additional `if` and `else` blocks allow the change in the behavior. Although it ultimately computes and returns the same result, it follows a slightly different approach for cases where n is zero, adding a bit more complexity to the computation process.
