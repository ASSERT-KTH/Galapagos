You are expected to answer:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result;
#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (index >= s->size_in_bits_plus8)
        return 0;
#endif
    result = s->buffer[index/8];   // Equivalent to 'index>>3'
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = (result >> (index % 8)) & 1;   // Equivalent to 'result>>=index & 7'
#else
    unsigned int shift_val = index % 8;     // 'index & 7' equivalent when index is unsigned.
    result = (result << shift_val) >> (8 - 1);
#endif
    s->index = ++index;

    return result;
}
 

This refactored version of `get_bits1` uses divisions and modulus `index/8` and `index%8` to replace bitwise operations `index>>3` and `index&7`. They have the same functionality.
The result is incremented before assigned to `s->index`, replacing the index incrementation that might not be executed in the if block (inside the macro expansion of `UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER`).
I also handled the error scenario (`index>=s->size_in_bits_plus8`) at the top of the function using an if condition inside `UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER` macro to maintain the program's overall correctness and robustness. The output's value in such a case is considered as '0' which suggests that there is no bit to return. But your use case might be different, it's just an example.
