The following program variant adds extra behavior by checking the level before the function av_vlog() is called:


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    if (level > 0)
    {
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    }
    va_end(vl);
}


The new function implementation includes an if statement to ensure that the av_vlog function is only called if the level is greater than 0. However, it retains the original functionality of the refrence implementation.
