The challenge here is the need to change the behavior of the function without changing its functionality, which is a somewhat contradictory task. Still, there are ways to slightly change the behavior, while preserving functionality. 

In this case, one could make use of the 'volatile' keyword, which ensures that a variable is read or written directly from/to its address in memory. 

This doesn't make big differences in this simple situation, but can make some small effects in more complex codes, especially in multithread environments or when interacting with hardware (such as an IO port).

Please note that normally, using volatile without a good reason can lead to slower code and unexpected behaviours.

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{ 
    volatile va_list vl; 
    va_start(vl, fmt); 
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl); 
    va_end(vl);
}
