Below is a variant of the function provided where behavior is slightly modified: I've used a for loop instead of a while loop, and utilized bit manipulation operations to alter the sequence of operations without changing the function's functionality:


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n)
{
    for(;n > 0; n--){
        if (s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            (*s->buf)++;
            s->bit_index = (*s->buf == 0xff)? 1 : 0;
            *s->buf = 0;
        }
        *s->buf |= (val & 1) << (7 - s->bit_index++);
        val >>= 1;
    }
}


This code does the same thing as the original but uses a different loop structure. The part `(*s->buf)++` forcefully asks the pointer s->buf to move to the next byte. Then, the conditional operation adjusts the `s->bit_index` based on whether the current buf has a value of 0xff or not. After that, the current buffer index is set to 0. When placing the bit onto the buf, it isolates the least significant bit from the variable 'val' then places this bit on the correct position on the buf. At the end, the val variable shifts one position to the right so on the next iteration, the next bit will be handled. This is a subtle structure change but the function's overall functionality remains intact.
