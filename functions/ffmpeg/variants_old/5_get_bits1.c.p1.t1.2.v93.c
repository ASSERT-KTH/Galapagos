Here is a valid variant of your function:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result     = s->buffer[index >> 3];

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result &= 1 << (index & 7);
    result >>= index & 7;
#else
    result &= 1 << (7 - (index & 7));
    result >>= 7 - (index & 7);
#endif

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
        s->index++;
#endif

    return result;
}


This alternative variant ensures that `result` will only hold the bit we're interested in while the others are set to zero. Even if the bitshift operations (`>>` and `<<`) are unpredictable for the irrelevant bits, thats will be fine as those bits are already zero. Then each remaining bitwise operation simply aligns the correct bit with the least significant bit (pixel 0) in the `result`. Overall, I believe this fits what you're asking for: it introduces important changes, but assumes a similar approach and has the same result.
