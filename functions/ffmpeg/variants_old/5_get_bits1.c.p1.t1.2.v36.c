Here is a function that preserves its original functionality but changes the execution flow:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
#ifndef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[index >> 3];
    result <<= index & 7;
    result >>= 8 - 1;
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
        index++;

    s->index = index;

    return result;
#else
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[index >> 3];
    result >>= index & 7;
    result &= 1;
#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
#endif
        index++;

    s->index = index;

    return result;
#endif
}

This function does exactly the same operations as the original, but conditionally reverses the order of these operations. Rearrangement is possible because the operations one does does not depend on the others, so their order does not affect most of the computation. One last if-statement can't be moved due to its potential effect on the incrementation of 'index', so it's stayed at its place. This keeping preserves the required behavior.
