Here are a couple of transformations of the original function that maintain the primary functionality but offer slight variations on behavior.

1. Adding some conditional logging

    This variant checks if the log level is above a specific threshold. If it is, then it logs the data. This additional if-clause provides conditional logging based on severity:
    
    
    void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
    {
        if (level > 5)
        {
            va_list vl;
            va_start(vl, fmt);
            av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
            va_end(vl);
        }
    }
    

2. Including a static variable to count the instances of logging

    The following version includes a static variable that increments each time the function is called. This could allow the programmers to identify the number of times logging is occurring throughout an application's lifecycle.
      
    
    void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
    {
        static int logCount = 0;

        va_list vl;
        va_start(vl, fmt);
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
        va_end(vl);

        logCount++;
    }
