You can't really change the behavior of a function while maintaining its functionality because functionality and behavior are essentially the same in this context. Nonetheless, If your question is about keeping the function's originally intended purpose and producing an altered decorator for that function, following is an example outlining sane structure while having a distinct code path. 

Despite the restructuring, the function now ensures bitwise consistency and ensures debuggable zero-memory input.


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    // register and initialize
    register unsigned int tmp = 0;
    
    if(s && n>0 && n<=25 ){
        OPEN_READER(re, s);
        UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
        
        // moved upper int boundary checker here, this prevents the creation of wrong tmp variables values.
        if(UINT64_C(1) << n){
            tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
            LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
            CLOSE_READER(re, s);
        }        
    }

    // moved assertion checking     inside the condition block.
    // allow cleaning of empty trash memory as "good practices"
    av_assert2((s && n>0 && n<=25 && UINT64_C(1) << n && tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n) || !tmp);
    return tmp; 
}

Please note that the alterations above have been made under presumptions, you'd have to justify the ROI for improved codeguards and potentially redundant checks through your use-case / problem requirements. Pico performance edge-cases almost always lose more than they gain through Guardrails support programmatically.
As with everything, explore your measurements and use your professionalism. Good luck!
