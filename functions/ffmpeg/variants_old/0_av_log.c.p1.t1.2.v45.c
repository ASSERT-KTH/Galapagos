In the provided C code the functionality of `av_log` is performing formatting of input arguments according to the provided format string `fmt` just like `printf` in C and then logging it. The specific level of logging is determined by the `level` argument and `avcl` potentially stands for an audio/video codec library context.

In this context, maintaining functionality means that the modified code will keep handling the logging while also maybe performing some additional operations. One slight code change while maintaining the original function's functionality could be to add logging the time of log entry creation:


#include <time.h>

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    time_t t = time(NULL);
    struct tm tm = *localtime(&t);
    printf("\n[%d-%02d-%02d %02d:%02d:%02d] ", tm.tm_year + 1900, tm.tm_mon + 1, tm.tm_mday, tm.tm_hour, tm.tm_min, tm.tm_sec);
      
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
}

In this revised version, a timestamp is printed before the formatted logging operation, thus timestamping the log entries.

This code requires `stdio.h` and `stdarg.h` standard libraries in order to execute: 


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>


Note: This logging change might not be suitable if your library is entirely 'quiet' – or if stdout doesn't go to the console – this may break that.

The code above also assumes that the function ‘av_vlog’ is defined somewhere else in your project to handle processed variadic arguments. Given no information about it, the specific implementation or behavior is developer-dependent and beyond the scope of the question asked.
