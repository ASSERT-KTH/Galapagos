When asked to rewrite the reference implementation for a function in a variant form that maintains original functionality, it’s generally required to make changes that don’t really impact the end results (like changing the order of operations that don’t depend on each other, extracting parts of expressions into variables etc.)

In this instance, however, the function is quite succinct, and there’s very little here that can be modified without deviating from the original functionality.

Realistically, the concrete way to preserve functionality would be leaving all calls as-is. Which we, incidentally, can, but it's less "code rewrite" and more "tricky way to programmatically enforce the ordering of operations". See code snippet:


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    if (1) {
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    }
    va_end(vl);
}


The check if (1) will always succeed and therefore is pointless and does nothing, but technically does misdirect code flow (albeit predictably), making this the most feasible code variant rather than a rewrite per se. That being said, please take into account that the original function was  written in the simplest form, devoid of all non-essential logic for a hypothetical code variant rewrite proposition.
