Please note that the below interpretation of your request may vary depending on the full context of your program.

Instead of displaying an assertion error when a given condition doesn't meet, I propose throwing an exception. Throwing an exception can change the behavior because if it's not properly handled in your calling scope, the rest of the code may not execute as opposed to an `av_assert2()` call which would just terminate the program. 

Here's your function maintaining the same functionality but potentially changing in behavior based on the execution context.


#include <limits.h>
#include <exception>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>

static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n) {

    register unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);

    // if given condition don't meet, throw error instead of av_assert2(
    if(!(n > 0 && n <= 25)) {
       throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid argument");
    }
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);

    if(!(tmp < static_cast<unsigned int>(1) << n)) {
        throw std::out_of_range("Out of range");
    }
    
    return tmp;
}

Please make sure to include the proper libraries for this. 
Notice that I swapped the av_assert2() functions for exceptions from the standard `std` C++ library. When these exceptions are not properly handled, this function might behave differently than the original. Besides other advantages, the exceptions make your code more 'debuggarable' especially when your code fails prematurely. A good practice when working with exceptions, is to try and catch them in the calling scope.
