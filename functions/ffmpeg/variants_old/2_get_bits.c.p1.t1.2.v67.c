A program variant that changes the wraps some of the code pieces into `if` statements to further validate the conditions but still maintains the original functionality:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp;
    if(s){
        OPEN_READER(re, s);
    }
    if(n>0 && n<=25){
        av_assert2(n>0 && n<=25);
        
        if(re && s){
            UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
            tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
            LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
        }

    }
    if(re && s) {
        CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    }
    
    if (tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n) {
        av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    }
    return tmp;
}
 

Here, wrapping statements with `if` checks provides additional checks in the function. This helps to ensure the validity of instances and data integrity while maintaining its original functionality (assuming that the check does not cause errors in the running program). Yet still, those checks are redundent in conditions of well organized inputs/syntax.  

Also, it's important to bear in mind the added condition check changes might affect timing slightly because of associated overheads. Always test function modifications for performance changes, especially in systems where such small time differences matter.
