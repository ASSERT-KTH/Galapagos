The given C function releases memory allocated by a previous function call and it accepts void pointers (which can pint to any type of data). A similar behavior can be achieved by adding safety errors, or validations, to check if the pointer is NULL before attempting to free it. Do note that using `free` on NULL pointers is permitted by standard, it does not do anything at all, but the `_aligned_free` could benefit given that behavior might be different according to the library implementation.

Without further information, this would be a reasonable enhancement, maintaining original functionality:


void av_free(void *ptr)
{
    if (ptr != NULL) {
#if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
        _aligned_free(ptr);
#else
        free(ptr);
#endif
    }
}


This version simply add checks, if `ptr` equals to `NULL`, before dealing with it further. This increases robustness albeit might have negligible impact in terms of functionality. It retains the rest of the functionality of 'av_free'.
