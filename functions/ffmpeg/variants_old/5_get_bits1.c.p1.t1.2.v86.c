Sure, here is a variant of the given function maintaining the same behavior.


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int result, shift_index, index;

    index = s->index;
    result = s->buffer[index >> 3];
    shift_index = index & 7;

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = (result >> shift_index) & 1;
#else
    result = (result << shift_index) >> (8 - 1);
#endif

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
        s->index++;
#else
    s->index = index + 1;
#endif

    return result;
}


This variant of the function still follows the basic functionality of extracting a single bit from a Bitstream Reader buffer. All operand calculations and checking are backed away into separate integer variables, which helps with code efficiency and readability. However, logic has been changed slightly to make single operation doing what the two operations were doing before to keep the code neat and efficient. The function ends with same increment in `index` variable and doesn't impact behavior of the method.
