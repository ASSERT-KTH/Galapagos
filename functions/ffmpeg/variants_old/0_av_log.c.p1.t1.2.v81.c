Below is a program variant that changes the behavior of the original function such that it checks the log level. If the level is too high, it alters it to a maximum threshold. The rest of the steps are performed as per the original function codes:


#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_LOG_LEVEL 5

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char* fmt, ...) 
{
    if(level > MAX_LOG_LEVEL) level = MAX_LOG_LEVEL;

    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
}

Note: The maximum log level (`MAX_LOG_LEVEL`) is set to 5 arbitrarily; it could be set to different level based on application rules. The new variant thus helps the function prevent excessively detailed or verbose logging by capping the maximum log level.
Also, `stdarg.h` included for variadic functions handling and `stdio.h` for I/O operations (if any used in `av_vlog` and such functions). Your baseline might not need these includes if they are already included some place else or non-relevant. Same is true for the macro `MAX_LOG_LEVEL`, if such constraint is defined elsewhere in your program, you don't need it in the function's vicinity.
