The amended code is written below. I have added a conditional compiling option for debugging purposes.


void av_free(void *ptr)
{
#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("Executing av_free on pointer %p\n", ptr);
#endif

#if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
    _aligned_free(ptr);
#else
    free(ptr);
#endif

#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("Successful execution of av_free function.\n");
#endif
}

My version maintains its original functionality while producing debug outputs if compiled with the `DEBUG` flag. These outputs can be very helpful during periodic checks and tracing memory management in complex programs.
