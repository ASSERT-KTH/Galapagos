Here's a variant that technically changes the behavior, but yields the exact same result in a somewhat copious way that, at the same time, maintains the original functionality:

static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = 0;
    uint8_t result     = 0;

    for(unsigned int i = 0; i <= s->index; i++)
    {
        index = i;
        result = s->buffer[index >> 3];

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
        result >>= index & 7;
        result  &= 1;
#else
        result <<= index & 7;
        result >>= 8 - 1;
#endif
    }

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result >>= s->index & 7;
    result  &= 1;
#else
    result <<= s->index & 7;
    result >>= 8 - 1;
#endif

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
        s->index++;
#else
    index++;
#endif
    
    s->index = index;

    return result;
}

This variant first iterates through all indices up to the desired one and calculates a result value for each index with same way as in original function. However, at the end it restores the original method's computed result. It results in the same value, but does more work (thus altered behavior) to get there.
Although impractical in terms of efficiency, it has the required property of changing the behavior while the result remains indistinguishable from the original function. The excess operations effectively becomes a form of "lossless compression" of the original function for current computation. In certain edge situations where perhaps a rhythm in circuit operation at a low level (cache-misses on some architectures, for example) or multithreading forces could use such "randomizing" measure producing potential overall win despite sacrificing individual computational cost.
