A variant that maintains the original functionality of the code but changes the behavior could be rewriting the function using a For loop. Here it is:


static void put_bits(Jpeg2000EncoderContext *s, int val, int n) // Optimized variant
{
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if (s->bit_index == 8)
        {
            s->bit_index = *s->buf == 0xff;
            *(++s->buf) = 0;
        }
        *s->buf |= val << (7 - s->bit_index++);
    }
}

This variant uses controlled looping in contrast to the original while loop and uses iterating construct (for loop) but implements the same functionality. Although the control flow has changed, the effect coming from this variant and the original implementation is the same.
