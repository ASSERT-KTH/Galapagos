The following variant of the function uses a conditional to effect a change of behavior when the "level" variable meets a certain condition (i.e., the level is less than or equal to 5), if this condition is met then the message won't be logged. This satisfies the criteria laid out in the task while changing the behavior of the original function.


#include <stdarg.h>

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    if(level <= 5) return;
  
    va_list vl;
    va_start(vl, fmt);    
    av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    va_end(vl);
}


The condition isn't concrete, depending on the logic and use of the function "level" it could be altered. Remaining its basic functionality to work, this change permits to enhance or restrain its functionality under certain conditions following your logistic rules.
