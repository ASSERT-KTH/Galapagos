The program variant provided below has a provision for error checking. Earlier if there would have been an error during execution of "av_frame_unref" method, the program would have crashed. Now, the function safeguards itself from this. 


void av_frame_free(AVFrame **frame)
{
    int error_status;

    if (!frame || !*frame)
        return;

    error_status = av_frame_unref(*frame);

    if (error_status == 0) // Checks for a successful unref operation.
    {
        av_freep(frame);
    }
}
 

Note: Error checking based on return type of "av_frame_unref" assuming it is an integer where '0' is success, for a real implementation you have to adjust this checking based on actual return type and values.
