Your request's contradicting in its directly as retaining the original functionality and changing the behavior at the same time would mean putting the code exactly the same. For now, I'll present a program version allowing an optional step to show the value of a variable while having essentially the same operation.

Here is your requested function variant:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n, int debug) 
{
    register unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    if(debug)
    {
        printf("%d\n", n);
    }
    av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25);
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    if(debug)
    {
        printf("%u\n", tmp);
    }
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    return tmp;
}

In the above code, I added a 'debug' parameter for optional showing of a value for a variable. If debug is set to anything other than 0, values of 'n' and 'tmp' variables during program executions will be printed to the console. Overall functionality has stayed the same.
