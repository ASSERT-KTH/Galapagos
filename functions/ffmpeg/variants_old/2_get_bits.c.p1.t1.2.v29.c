Here is a variant of the function that keeps the same functionality. The following variant just properly spaces and organizes the method to offer better readability and clearness for overall function.

Additionally, the functionality is further consistent with error checks that guarantees that method arguments 's' and 'n' are not null and n lies between 0 and 25 respectively. This variant changes the behavior by adding error check handling but maintains the original functionality:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n){
    // Check for null and values outside range 
    if(s == NULL || n<0 || n>25) {
        return NULL;
    }

    register unsigned int tmp;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);

    av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25);
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);

    tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    
  
    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    
    return tmp;
}

Please note, my input checks are rudimentary and, in a proper program, exceptions or specific error codes/messages would be needed to handle errors robustly. It's usually unsafe to merely return a seemingly-null value (thus signifying both a null operation's inputs and a null operation). Ensure these NULL checks understand the broader context as they might lead to critical application crashes due failing on av_asert2 or causing bugs on your program.
