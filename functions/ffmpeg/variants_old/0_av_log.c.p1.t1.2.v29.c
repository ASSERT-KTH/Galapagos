Here is a version of the function that maintains its original functionality but also incorporates changes for enhanced behavior. This function now checks the log level before processing.


#include<stdarg.h>

void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...){
    if(level<=LOG_LEVEL){
        va_list vl;
        va_start(vl, fmt);
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
        va_end(vl);
    }
}

Here, LOG_LEVEL is a predetermined level cut-off for log messages. If the passed 'level' is above this LOG_LEVEL, the log message is perceived as unimportant and will be ignored. This way, you can control information verbosity, based on the importance, by implementing a simple logging system with different log levels.

Please make sure that LOG_LEVEL variable declared is somewhere above this function or passed as a definition. Also, avoid name collision between this new function `av_log` with the older one. Make sure the signature of `av_vlog()` function as use will accept an object of type `va_list`.

Keep in mind this may differ from other software components as av_vlog, LOG_LEVEL should be consistent with the software component which hosts this function.
