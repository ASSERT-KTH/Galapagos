The modified function while maintaining its original functionality is shown below:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp;
    unsigned long int tmp2;
    
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(n>0 && n<=25);
    
    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
    tmp2 = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
    tmp = (unsigned int) tmp2;
    
    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(tmp2 < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    
    return tmp;
}


In this function, instead of placing the result of `SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n)` directly in `tmp`, it is now placed in a temporary `unsigned long long int` named `tmp2`.

Then, `tmp2` is truncated to an `unsigned int` and stored in `tmp`. 

The check in `av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);` has been converted to `av_assert2(tmp2 < UINT64_C(1) << n);`. By introducing and checking `tmp2`, we can verify if `tmp2`, which contains the full-width result of `SHOW_UBITS`, is less than `1 << n`. This change can be used to prevent undetected overflows from happening when `SHOW_UBITS` returns more than 32 bits.

This change does not alter any functionality or the output of the original function, but allows error checking for potential bugs. Beyond that, the overall structure and behavior are kept intentionally identical to maintain compatibility and match the original.
