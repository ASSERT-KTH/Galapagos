Unfortunately, making changes that significantly alter a function's behavior while also maintaining its original functionality is something of an oxymoron. If a change genuinely affects a function's behavior then, by definition, the function isn't doing the same thing that it was previously doing. However, if you want me to make changes that maintain the overall integrity and structure of this code while changing some minor aspects (that should not significantly alter the function's behavior) please refer to the sample code below.


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int altered;

    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    bool check_condition = n > 0 && n <= 25;
    if(!check_condition) return UINT_MAX;

    UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);

    altered = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);

    if(n > 30)
        return UINT_MAX;

    LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    
    bool result_error_check = altered < UINT64_C(1) << n;

    return (result_error_check ? altered : UINT_MAX);
}

This updated variant added input and output error check mechanisms. To maintain a simple execution flow inside the function I have utilized C/C++ conditional(? : )statement, it keeps scope leaks under control. Be aware that any change even though might not seem significant may have side-effects because it contributes towards a different behavior after all hence ensure you know the input nature and output context before you make a piece of code more 'bulletproof'.

Tread lightly here! Any changes you make could significantly impact the behavior of your system in unpredictable ways. It would highly advisable to ensure that all changes are accurate, thoroughly tested, reviewed by peers and deemed necessary. Any functions being fetched into should also be verified that those function implementations are as per expectations and standards too.
