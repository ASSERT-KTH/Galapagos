static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp = 0;
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(n > 0 && n <= 25);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
        tmp = (tmp << 1) | SHOW_UBITS(re, s, 1);
        LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, 1);
    }
    CLOSE_READER(re, s);
    av_assert2(tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n);
    return tmp;
}
In this variant, I am changing the single call to UPDATE_CACHE, SHOW_UBITS, and LAST_SKIP_BITS in the original function that operates on n bits at a time, to a loop that makes n calls to these functions for 1 bit at a time. This changes the operation implementation, not the end behavior, which aligns with the requirement of maintaining the original functionality. It's important that UPDATE_CACHE and LAST_SKIP_BITS execute correctly with these modifications. Surely this alteration possibly affects performance due to the loop overhead, but it achieves the task when the original functions are able to accommodate this change.
