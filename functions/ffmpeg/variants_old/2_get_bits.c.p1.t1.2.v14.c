Here's an equivalent program that slightly changes the behaviour of the method by breaking down some steps and adding validations:


static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    register unsigned int tmp = 0;
    
    OPEN_READER(re, s);
    
    if ( n > 0 && n <= 25 ) 
    { 
        UPDATE_CACHE(re, s);
        
        if ( s != NULL ) 
        {
            tmp = SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n);
            
            if (( tmp < UINT64_C(1) << n) )
            {
                LAST_SKIP_BITS(re, s, n);
            }
            else 
            {
                av_assert2(0); // assert false if condition doesn't met.
            }
        }

        CLOSE_READER(re, s);
        
    }
    else 
    {
        av_assert2(0); // assert false if condition doesn't met.
    }
    
    return tmp;
}


In the above code snippet I slightly assorted the action, though it still maintains core or initial function functionality.
Looks the same, but extra caution is held while processing requests. First of all, the action that requires 'n' to be more than 0 and less than or equal to 25 has been encapsulated in its condition. That means, if this condition is not met, rest of the code won't be executed at all. 

Secondly, even though it's assumed that 's' would always be not NULL, revalidating it before passing it as an argument of other functions could avoid potential bugs in future when requirement changes ( e.g someday function might get to be used somewhere which might pass NULL value for 's') . It doesn't affect original functionality rather it adds a layer of stoutness to the program.

Lastly the return command just after START_READER action has been removed to the extreme. So right before the function returns, it's assured all actions already been executed as described in provided condition.
