Here is an alternate version of the provided function av_free that preserves the original functionality.


void av_free(void *ptr)
{
    if(!ptr)
    {
        return;
    }
#if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
    _aligned_free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
#else
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
#endif
}


This variant adds a guards clause, checking if ptr is NULL at the start of the function, ensuring that the function is not invoked with a null pointer. It additionally sets ptr to NULL after freeing, which might help prevent dangling pointer troubles. However, the new code does not have an actual effect given that C is pass-by-value, so a copy of the passed pointer is made by the av_free function. Changing ptr to NULL would not affect the copies outside the scope of this function.
