Based on the task's constraints of maintaining original functionality and signature without using helper functions, a variant might be to simplify some operations and rearrange the section where the method decodes the bit index:


static int get_bits(Jpeg2000DecoderContext *s, int n)
{
    int res = 0;
    int bit;

    for (; n > 0; --n) {
        if (s->bit_index == 0) {
            s->bit_index = 8 - bytestream2_get_byte(&s->g);
        }
        bit = bytestream2_peek_byte(&s->g);
        s->bit_index--;
        res = ((res << 1) | ((bit >> s->bit_index) & 1));
    }

    return res;
}


This approach traverses the given bits in reverse order to get each bit at a time which should theoretically decrease overall execution time and reduce consumption of stack frame memory as there is lesser information to pass around between variable registrations as compared to the while loop used in the original implementation.
