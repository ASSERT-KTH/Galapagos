Here is an example of a program variant. This new function maintains the original behavior but also clears the memory region before releasing it. The purpose of this change could be to increase the safety and security by wiping the sensitive or personal data before memory deallocation.


void av_free(void *ptr)
{
    if(ptr != NULL) {
        memset(ptr, 0, sizeof(*ptr));
    }

#if HAVE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
    _aligned_free(ptr);
#else
    free(ptr);
#endif
}
