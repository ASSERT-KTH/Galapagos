Actually, since the problem specifically stated that the program needs to "**Change the behavior of the original function while maintaining its original functionality**". It means an identical function but with different "coding behaviors", not different outcomes.

My notion of changing the behavior could be: changing coding styles, sequence of operations, use other equivalent operation, error check, optimizations...

Because "'behavior" in coding normally means more or less "what/how the code does".

Here is an equivalent function:
(note that for that task we can not alter function input and output - in other words - signature of function, my understanding about this task about is to rewrite its implementation in a different way)

static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int shifted_val = s->index >> 3;
    uint8_t temp_result  = s->buffer[shifted_val];
    unsigned int indexed_check = s->index & 7;

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    temp_result >>= indexed_check;
#else
    shift_left_amount = 8 - 1;
    temp_result <<= indexed_check;
    temp_result >>= shift_left_amount;
#endif
    temp_result &= 1;

    if UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
        return temp_result;
    else {
        bool index_in_bound = s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8;
        s->index++;
        return index_in_bound ? temp_result : 0;
    }
}

Here I am just decompose the operations to make it clearer what they are doing.
