Here's a variant that performs exactly as the original get_bits1() function using bitwise operations in a slightly different manner. The condition check for UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER is inverted for readability, and parentheses are used around bitshifting operations for clarity. 

Important note: Since the directives BITSTREAM_READER_LE and UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER are being defined at compile time (couldn't be observed in the code snippet you provided), the only noteworthy difference would be in terms of code styling and organization.


static inline unsigned int get_bits1_variant(GetBitContext *s) {
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[index / 8];

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = (result >> (index % 8)) & 1;
#else
    result = (result << (index % 8)) >> 7;
#endif

#if UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER == 0
    if (index < s->size_in_bits_plus8) 
#endif
        s->index = ++index;

    return result;
}
