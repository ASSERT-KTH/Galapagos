The strict requirements provided might prevent significant rearrangement or arguably any behavioral changes, as the functionality principles should hold. However, some redundant error-checks and optimizations can be added acting purely on the logic in the given context.

Remember that the theory of variations and behavioral changes can differ depending on how experts read this, but it can potentially change based on the error handling, as you see on this subtle variation. 

Also, consider that a total understanding of the used extra helper functions such as OPEN_READER, UPDATE_CACHE..etc, might give a deeper refactoring; usually this requires proprietary insights if any exists as what are these operations altering.
