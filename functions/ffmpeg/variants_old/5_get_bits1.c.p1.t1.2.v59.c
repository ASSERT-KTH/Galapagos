Here's a variant of the function provided:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result;

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    if (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)
#endif
    {
        result = s->buffer[index >> 3];
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
        result >>= index & 7;
#else
        result <<= index & 7;
        result >>= 8 - 1;
#endif
        s->index = ++index;
    }
    else
    {
        result = 0;
    }

    return result;
}


This program variant slightly changes the structure of the original program by ensuring the operation regarding the variable result occurs only under a specific condition, not unconditionally as it was before. This change does not alter the original functionality and purpose of the function.
This variant also changed the increment operation on variable index from postfix to prefix for marginal performance benefits.
but when considering readability and understanding by most C programmers, prefix ++index is preferable in this scenario as the purpose is to increment the value before using it. This is more expressive of intention if we increment beforehand rather than to use and then increment since the incremented value isn't built for that snippet.
This change involves a lot of assessment about specifics of the code context which I lack, so it might not always be the best choice. This also presumes that there are not other usages of the index post this usage on this local scope before getting updated in the end.
