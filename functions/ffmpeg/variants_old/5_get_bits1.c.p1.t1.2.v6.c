Here's a variant of the code, keeping all the logic the same while changing its structure:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s) 
{
    uint8_t result;
    unsigned int tmp_index = s->index;
    result = s->buffer[tmp_index / 8];

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = (result >> (tmp_index % 8)) & 1;
#else
    result = (result << (tmp_index % 8)) / 256;
#endif

#if !UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    s->index = tmp_index + (s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8);
#else
    s->index++;
#endif
    return result;
}

  
Here, we've replaced the bit shift for division and modulus, as per the equivalence `(n >> 3) == n / 8` and `(n & 7) == n % 8`, and changed `(result >> (8 - 1))` to `(result / 256)`, among other minor style modifications.

Note: Both styles have their own clearness. The second version might be more simplified together with longer implementation-independent operations. The first variant might look cleaner on hardware and low-level system related tasks or seem more efficient due to use of bit-wise operations which are usually faster than arithmetic ones. Use whichever decoding aligns best with your platform, programming standards or personal preference.
