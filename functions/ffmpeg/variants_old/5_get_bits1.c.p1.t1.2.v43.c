Certainly. Remember that this variant of the function keeps the exact original functionality but employs different instructions to achieve same functionality.
Here is another possible equivalent of your initial function:


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s)
{
    unsigned int shift_amount = (s->index) % 8;
    uint8_t result = (s->index) < (s->size_in_bits_plus8) ? s->buffer[(s->index)++ >> 3] : 0;
#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    result = (result >> shift_amount) & 1;
#else
    result = (result << shift_amount) >> (8 - 1);
#endif
    return result;
}


This alternate implementation applies conditional assignment optimizing away the need for additional increment. The expression `s->index % 8` is just an alternative way to express `s->index & 7` in way that might be clearer or more familiar to some coders. Also eliminated was the need for the separate variables, by using direct dereferences and in-place increment operation.
