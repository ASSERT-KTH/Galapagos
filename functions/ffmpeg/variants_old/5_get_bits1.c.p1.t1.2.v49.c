Here is a variant that preserves the original functionality, is rewritten in a bit simpler manner and also has debugging print statements to aid developers.

`DEBUG_PRINT1` can be defined on a system for debugging purposes if needed. If `DEBUG_PRINT1` is not present, it simply evaluates nowhere. This allows debugging insertion without changing the functionality of the method to the caller and eliminates need to remove these statements, in production. Oh and `LIKELY` (and `UNLIKELY` macros) are often used to provide compiler hints about the branching, these are optional too.


static inline unsigned int get_bits1(GetBitContext *s) {

    DEBUG_PRINT1("__Function Entered: get_bits1\n");
    unsigned int index = s->index;
    uint8_t result = s->buffer[index >> 3];

#ifdef BITSTREAM_READER_LE
    DEBUG_PRINT1("__Branch Executed: BITSTREAM_READER_LE\n");
    result = (result >> (index & 7)) & 1;
#else
    DEBUG_PRINT1("__Branch NOT Executed: BITSTREAM_READER_LE\n");
    result = (result << (index & 7)) >> (8 - 1);
#endif

#ifdef UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER
    DEBUG_PRINT1("__Branch NOT Executed: UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER\n");
#else
    if (LIKELY(s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8)) {
        DEBUG_PRINT1("__Branch Executed: s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8\n");
        ++index;
    }
    else
        DEBUG_PRINT1("__Branch NOT Executed: s->index < s->size_in_bits_plus8\n");
#endif
    s->index = index;

    DEBUG_PRINT1("__Function Exit: get_bits1\n");
    return result;
}


For production grade code `DEBUG_PRINT1` should be commented out and this eliminates all the print messages originating from the defined debug prints.

#define DEBUG_PRINT1(message) // printf("%s", message);
