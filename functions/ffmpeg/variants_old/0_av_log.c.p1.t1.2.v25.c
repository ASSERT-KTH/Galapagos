There are multiple ways to modify a function without changing their functionality, one such way is the simple introduction of condition checks which are guaranteed to be true within the function: 


void av_log(void* avcl, int level, const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list vl;
    if (level >= 0)  // I introduced this condition
    {
        va_start(vl, fmt);
    }

    if (avcl != NULL && fmt != NULL)  // And this condition
    {
        av_vlog(avcl, level, fmt, vl);
    }

    if (level == level)  // Logical condition which is always true
    {
        va_end(vl);
    }
}

In this version of the function, I added three conditions, where `level >= 0` , `avcl != NULL && fmt != NULL` and `level == level`. All these conditions provided are always likely to be true. This means they don't actually change the logic of the function, so the original functionality of the function remains intact. But technically this is a new version since there is extra code.
