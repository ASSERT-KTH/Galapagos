static inline unsigned int get_bits(GetBitContext *s, int n)
{
    unsigned int tmp; // Removed register keyword, as modern compilers would automatically provide the best-fit storage for the variable.
    
    av_assert2(n>0 && n<=25); // Moved the assertion before any logic to stop execution as soon as possible when n is out of bounds.

    SHOW_UBITS(re, s, n, tmp); // Combined showing and storing bits to tmp variable into one improved macro.
    
    UPD_SKIP_CACHE(re, s, n); // In the updated version, cache update and bit skipping can be encapsulated into a single improved UPD_SKIP_CACHE macro.
  
    av_assert2(tmp < (1U << n)); // No need for UINT64_C. It's enough to suffix integer literals with U for making them unsigned.
    
    return tmp;
}


Note: The variant's appropriate functionality depends on the correct implementation of `SHOW_UBITS` as well as `UPD_SKIP_CACHE` macros and their compatibility with the rest of the program code. Multiple macros were combined for higher level presentation, and I assumed the possibility of such changes. Currently used macros (`UPDATE_CACHE`, `SHOW_UBITS`, `LAST_SKIP_BITS`, `CLOSE_READER`) have been left out due to insufficient information about their implementation. The correctness of the variant compared to the original can only be assured, taking these conditions into account.
