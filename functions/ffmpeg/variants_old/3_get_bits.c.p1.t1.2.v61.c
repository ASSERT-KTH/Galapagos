Here's one way to keep the original functionality while changing the behavior of the provided method:


static int get_bits(Jpeg2000DecoderContext *s, int n)
{
    int res = 0, to_check;

    for(int i = n; i > 0; i--){
        res <<= 1;
        if(s->bit_index == 0) {
            to_check = bytestream2_get_byte(&s->g);
            s->bit_index = 7 + (to_check != 0xFFu);
        }
        s->bit_index--;
        res |= (bytestream2_peek_byte(&s->g) >> s->bit_index) & 1;
    }
    return res;
}

In this altered version of the function, instead of reducing the value of `n` within the loop condition itself, I've changed the loop to a 'for' loop, decrementing `n` for each iteration within the loop start condition. Introduced a new variable `to_check` to temporarily store the value taken from `bytestream2_get_byte(&s->g)` before the value is processed, still maintaining the original functionality as requested.
