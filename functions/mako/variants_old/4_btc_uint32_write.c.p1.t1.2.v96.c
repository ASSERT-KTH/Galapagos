It appears there may be a misunderstanding in the task since changing the behavior of the function while preserving its functionality seems contradictory. The provided function copies a 32-bit unsigned integer into an array of 8-bit unsigned integers in a binary format. The manner in which it's done differs based on byte ordering. So, here's an alternate approach that keeps the same functionality while altering the manner it is implemented.


void btc_uint32_write(uint8_t *zp, uint32_t x) {
    int i;

#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        *zp++ = (x >> (i*8));
    }
#else
    uint8_t *xp = (uint8_t*)&x;
    for(i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        *zp++ = *xp++;
    }
#endif
}


Note: Since the processor endianness is compiled directly into the binary, it doesn't matter that we're no longer swapping bytes when copying to `zp` in the little-endian version - the data will be read correctly from memory regardless.
