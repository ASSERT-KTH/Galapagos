This function reads a 32-bit integer from a byte array and packs it into a given 32-bit unsigned integer either in BE (Big Endian) byte order or in native by using memcpy.

In the given variant, I understand maintaining the original functionality to mean maintaining the existing successful outcomes faced by consumers of the function, and the variation of behavior can be found internally e.g., how errors are managed/tracked.

Given this understanding, we can re-implement with an early-return strategy which flips the  error handling condition to detect if we have an available action to execute:


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t* zp, const uint8_t** xp, size_t* xn) 
{
  if(*xn >= 4){
     #if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
        *zp = ((uint32_t)(*xp)[0] <<  0)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[1] <<  8)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[2] << 16)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[3] << 24);
     #else
        memcpy(zp, *xp, sizeof(*zp));
     #endif

   *xp += 4;
   *xn -= 4;

   return 1;
   }
   return 0;
}


In the new variant, we flipped the condition to check if the size of the byte stream is enough to read a 32-bit integer. Otherwise, none of the steps in the function are taken, leaving the function early. This iteration counts with a natural proof fence: If we have less than 4 bytes to read, none of the operations in the function can proceed â€“ maintaining the same logic, but taking a defensively oriented attitude regarding checking for and raising error states.
