You can modify the function by adding a print statement to output a message when memory is successfully freed. The called function will still perform its task of attempting to free the memory block pointed by ptr. When successful, it simply outputs a message indicating the successful action. This is one of the various logging scenarios wherein a function will report back its operation result. Here is a minor variant to change the behavior:


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void btc_free(void *ptr) {
  if (ptr == NULL) {
    abort();
    return;
  }

  free(ptr);
  
  /* Print message indicating memory was freed if the execution reaches this point.*/
  printf("Memory successfully freed\n");
}
 

Please keep in mind that this version stimulates a console output and slightly changes the original function's behavior.
