Sure, the following piece of code maintains the original functionality of the given code while changing its internal behavior. I’ve replaced the bitwise operations area with individual byte assignments, for both big-endian and little-endian cases:


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {
  if (*xn < 4)
    return 0;

#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  *zp = 0;
  ((uint8_t*)zp)[0] = (*xp)[0];
  ((uint8_t*)zp)[1] = (*xp)[1];
  ((uint8_t*)zp)[2] = (*xp)[2];
  ((uint8_t*)zp)[3] = (*xp)[3];
#else
  *zp = *(*xp) | (*((*xp) + 1) << 8) | (*((*xp) + 2) << 16) | (*((*xp) + 3) << 24);
#endif

  *xp += 4;
  *xn -= 4;

  return 1;
}
 

Please note - here we effectively reimplemented the `memcpy()` method. If you're using any standard C compiler, the former version should be more performant. Code modification only demonstrates that it's simple to reimplement memory copying, but it isn't a good practice to recreate standard library functions. In nearly all cases, the standards library functions’ efficiency would be better.
