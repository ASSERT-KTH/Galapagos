Here is a code variant that implements the functionality of the aforementioned function but in a different manner.


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {
  if (*xn < sizeof(uint32_t))
    return 0;

  // create a temp buffer
  const char temp[4] = {(*xp)[0], (*xp)[1], (*xp)[2], (*xp)[3]};;

#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  *zp = *(uint32_t*)(temp);
#else
  *zp = temp[3] << 24 | temp[2] << 16 | temp[1] << 8 | temp[0];
#endif

  *xp += sizeof(uint32_t);
  *xn -= sizeof(uint32_t);

  return 1;
}

This code variant maintains an identical functionality to the initial function but uses a slightly different approach with slightly different coding practices. Note that this code relies on the assumption that the platform you're using allows unaligned memory access for the BTC_BIGENDIAN case. If your architecture does not allow it, this approach may cause issues. Please consult your platform or compiler's specific documentation for any limitations.
