The following C code is a variation of the provided function which preserves the original functionality by encoding a 32-bit unsigned integer into a pointer to an 8-bit integer.

The primary difference is the use of an if-else statement enforcing endianness rather than a preprocessor directive, which can make your program easier to test and debug. It also doesn't directly copy the data in little endian systems, instead it writes it in the correct order to help avoid potential issues.

Let's say your CPU is little endian but your network protocol or file expects numbers in big-endian order. The naively copying over values assumes that the reader of your code is using the same CPU architecture as you do, which could generate confusion in case of incompatible system architectures.

So here is the program variant:


#include <stdint.h>

uint8_t* btc_uint32_write(uint8_t *zp, uint32_t x) {
    int num = 1;
    // Determines if system is Little Endian
    if (*(char *)&num == 1)
    {
        *zp++ = (x & 0xff);
        *zp++ = (x >> 8) & 0xff;
        *zp++ = (x >> 16) & 0xff;
        *zp++ = (x >> 24) & 0xff;
    } else { // System is Big Endian
        *zp++ = (x >> 24) & 0xff;
        *zp++ = (x >> 16) & 0xff;
        *zp++ = (x >> 8) & 0xff;
        *zp++ = x & 0xff;
    }

  return zp;
}

The function uses a bitwise operation to convert 32-bit x into byte-stored format according to the system endianness. The `(char *)&num == 1` check will return 1 for a system with little endian format and 0 for a system with big endian. It checks this by writing to memory the bitwise representation of the integer on that system and then reads it as a char (1 byte), the choice of using 1 as a test integer guarantees the desired output. Therefore uses an if-else branch to write byte by byte the 32-bit x into an 8-bit pointer following the necessary format.
