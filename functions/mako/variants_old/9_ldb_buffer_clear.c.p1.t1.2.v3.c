Here's a program variant of your C function that maintains the original functionality:


ldb_buffer_clear(ldb_buffer_t *z) {
  if (!z) 
    return;

  if (z->data != NULL)
    ldb_free(z->data);

  z->data = NULL;
  z->alloc = z->size = 0;
}


This variant adds a NULL pointer check at the start, which is a good practice when working with pointers. This extra check can protect program from segmentation faults occurring in the case when the ldb_buffer_t *z receives NULL. Additionally, it also checks for NULL on z->data before freeing it up and uses less lines by setting both z->alloc and z->size to 0 in the same line.
