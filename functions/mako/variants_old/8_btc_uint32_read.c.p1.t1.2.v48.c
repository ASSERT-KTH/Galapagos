The original function reads a four-byte integer from a buffer in big endian or little endian according to the `BTC_BIGENDIAN` macro definition, adjusts the buffer pointer and leftover byte count. This variant achieves the same outcome by changing some of the code logic.

The code enforces data reading from a uint8_t array and converts the four bytes into a uint32_t depending on the endianess system.


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {
  if (*xn < sizeof(*zp))
      return 0;

  uint8_t *tmp = (uint8_t *)zp;
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  tmp[3] = *(*xp)++;
  tmp[2] = *(*xp)++;
  tmp[1] = *(*xp)++;
  tmp[0] = *(*xp)++;
#else
  tmp[0] = *(*xp)++;
  tmp[1] = *(*xp)++;
  tmp[2] = *(*xp)++;
  tmp[3] = *(*xp)++;
#endif

  *xn -= sizeof(*zp);
  return 1;
}

This program achieves the same effect without utilizing memcpy(), instead using pointer arithmetic to directly move values from the input buffer to the target 32-int register. This operation also eliminates the potential of introducing extra temporary buffers. By utilizing increment pointers, it can progress the path in one smooth pass, and at the same time, read and adjust the buffer. This approach could conceivably provide higher performance on certain bridged systems because it does not use function calls.
