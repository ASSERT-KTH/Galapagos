In this variant, A NULL check has been added to handle the case of `z` being NULL. If `z` is NULL, the function immediately returns/calls no other functions and tries to access no fields. This accommodates more robust usage without changing the original contract when `z` is not NULL. Time complexity and memory complexity are still O(1), as no new data structures or loops have been introduced.
