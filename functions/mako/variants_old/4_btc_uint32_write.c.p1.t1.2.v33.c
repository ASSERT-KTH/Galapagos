I added explicit casting to `uint8_t` when writing bytes on a `BTC_BIGENDIAN` system. On a little-endian system, instead of using `memcpy`, I added a loop that manually copies bytes from `xp` (a `uint8_t` pointer version of the input `x`) to `zp`. This still maintains the original functionality while changing up the implementation a bit. The return statement has been removed as the original function definition doesn't explicitly state a return type, assuming it's a `void` function.
