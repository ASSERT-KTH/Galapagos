The following code is a program variant of the original function:


void ldb_buffer_clear(ldb_buffer_t *z) {
  if(z == NULL)
    return;

  if (z->alloc && z->data != NULL) {
    ldb_free(z->data);
    z->data = NULL;
  }

  z->size = z->alloc = 0;
}


The function now safeguards against a hypothetical scenario where it might be asked to clear an uninitialized or a NULL buffer, which was not considered in the original function. This additional feature of handling mentioned scenario is included in the program, without sacrificing the original functionality.
