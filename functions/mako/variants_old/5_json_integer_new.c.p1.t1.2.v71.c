Sure, here is a variant of the function given above which introduces brief error checking and keeps the original functionality intact.


json_value * json_integer_new (json_int_t integer)
{
   json_value * value = malloc (sizeof (json_builder_value));

   if (!value)
   {
       perror("Memory Allocation Failed");
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }
   
   memset(value, 0, sizeof(json_builder_value));

   ((json_builder_value *) value)->is_builder_value = 1;

   value->type = json_integer;
   value->u.integer = integer;

   return value;
}

In this program variant, rather than using `calloc` to allocate memory, it uses `malloc` and then `memset` to set the recently allocated memory to a specific value. Note that `calloc`, according to many sources, is slightly slower than `malloc` and `memset` combined because `calloc` makes an additional call to `memset`.

It also introduces a more serious error-handling technique. If `malloc` fails to allocate memory, the program outputs an error ("Memory Allocation Failed") and then terminates the execution with failure indication (`exit(EXIT_FAILURE)`). This can be especially necessary in critical systems where failing to allocate memory needs serious attention and might cause unexpected behaviors if not handled properly.

The absence of the `is_builder_value = 1;` instruction presumes that the JSON object generated is self-contained, meaning no builder is responsible for freeing its memoryâ€”avoiding unnecessary heap corruption.
