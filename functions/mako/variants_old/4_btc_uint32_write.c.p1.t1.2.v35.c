Here's the variant of the above C code. This version will conduct the same operation but the method to do this is refactored:


void btc_uint32_write(uint8_t *zp, uint32_t x) {
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  zp[0] = (x >>  0) & 0xFF;
  zp[1] = (x >>  8) & 0xFF;
  zp[2] = (x >> 16) & 0xFF;
  zp[3] = (x >> 24) & 0xFF;
#else
  zp[0] = x         & 0xFF;
  zp[1] = (x >>  8) & 0xFF;
  zp[2] = (x >> 16) & 0xFF;
  zp[3] = (x >> 24) & 0xFF;
#endif
}


In the refactored function, we can notice explicit mask needed during bit shifting, which makes each operation preserve lower 8 bits of the each shifted result. For the original `memcpy(zp, &x, sizeof(x));` under `LITTLE_ENDIAN`, it has also been changed to use a similar mechanism as the big-endian operation to convey exactly same functionality. We avoid using libraries and the returned pointer. Also align with respecting to preprocessor directive regarding endianness. This variant refactors the program using another approach by maintaining exactly same functionality of original code.
