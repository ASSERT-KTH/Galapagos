Here is the variant that adds some code section but not affects the original functionality.


void btc_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
  // Inititional checking for not negative length
  // Notice : this checking doesn't affect original function logic 
  // because in original function 'len' also considered as a non-negative value as being size_t type
  if (len <= 0)
      return;
      
#if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)
  memset(ptr, 0, len);

  __asm__ __volatile__ (
    ""
    :: "r" (ptr)
    : "memory"
  );
#elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)
  SecureZeroMemory(ptr, len);
#else
  static void *(*const volatile memset_ptr)(void *, int, size_t) = memset;
  memset_ptr(ptr, 0, len);
#endif
}


In this variant the function immediately returns in the situation when `len` is zero or less. Although generally 'len' should be always be non negative because 'len' defined with the type size_t (unsigned integers from 0 to `SIZE_MAX`) , this guarantees that memset or similar functions are never called with a zero 'len'. But as a general condition one can consider such feature. So it doesnâ€™t affect the original behavior, it provides an accession into service calls. The rest semantics for functionality stays is identical to the original function.
