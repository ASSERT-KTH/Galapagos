Here is an alternate version of the `btc_memzero` function, which behaves similarly, but is written a bit differently. The condition checking for `len > 0` is placed outside of the microprocessor-specific and platform-specific checks, thus reducing code redundancy. Furthermore, the else case has been replaced with a more direct call to `memset`.


void btc_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
  if (len > 0) {
#if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)
    memset(ptr, 0, len);
    __asm__ __volatile__ (
        ""
        :: "r" (ptr)
        : "memory"
    );
#elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)
    SecureZeroMemory(ptr, len);
#else
    memset(ptr, 0, len);
#endif
  } 
}

The optimized variant maintains the same functionality by zeroing out memory specified by `ptr` with a length of `len`. Depending on predefined microprocessor outlines or operating system specifics it uses different methods to perform the action.
