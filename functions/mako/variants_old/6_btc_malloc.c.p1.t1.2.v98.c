Here's a variation of the function above. In this variant, the function checks the value of size before passing it to malloc. If size is zero, the function will return NULL instead of calling abort(). This ensures that the function won't terminate when size is zero.


#include <stdlib.h>

void *btc_malloc(size_t size) {
  void *ptr = NULL;
  
  if (size != 0) {
    ptr = malloc(size);
    if (ptr == NULL)
      abort(); 
  }
  
  return ptr;
}


This new variant of the function maintains the functionality of the original btc_malloc(). However, unlike the previous version which crashes when size is equal to zero, this variant of the function handles the edge case by returning NULL.

Under normal circumstances, you should not pass zero to functions like malloc() and calloc() because their behavior with size 0 can be unpredictable. Some implementations return a non-null pointer which you should not dereference but which can still be passed to free(). Other implementations may return a NULL pointer. Therefore, it's always safest to avoid calling these functions with size 0.
