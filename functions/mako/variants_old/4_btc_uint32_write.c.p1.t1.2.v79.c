In this alternative implementation, the mentioned loopholes concerning pointer assignment during iteration (which generally would be handled by a call-like context to prevent unwanted side-effects) have been addressed. The return type of the function has also been altered to match the usual convention of not expecting a return value from a write operation. Overall functionality is consequently preserved.
