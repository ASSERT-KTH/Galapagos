The variant program below adds an additional level of input validation whilst still maintaining the functionality of the reference implementation of the function. If the input pointers are null, the function now returns an error code of 2. This function essentially parses a 32-bit unsigned integer from a byte stream and also keeps track of how many bytes are left. 


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {
  if (zp == NULL || xp == NULL || xn == NULL)
    return 2;
  
   if (*xn < 4)
     return 0;

#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  *zp = ((uint32_t)(*xp)[0] <<  0)
      | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[1] <<  8)
      | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[2] << 16)
      | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[3] << 24);
#else
  memcpy(zp, *xp, sizeof(*zp));
#endif

  *xp += 4;
  *xn -= 4;

  return 1;
}

In the provided function:

  - `zp` is a pointer to where the parsed uint32 should be stored
  - `xp` is a pointer to a pointer to bytes intended to being parsed
  - `xn` represents how many bytes are left
