Sure, you can refactor and optimize the function a bit using ternary operator, bitmasking and left bit shift, but keeping the original functionality intact.


void btc_uint32_write(uint8_t *zp, uint32_t x) {
  zp[0] = (uint8_t)((x >> 24) & 0xFF);
  zp[1] = (uint8_t)((x >> 16) & 0xFF);
  zp[2] = (uint8_t)((x >> 8) & 0xFF);
  zp[3] = (uint8_t)((x >> 0) & 0xFF);

 #if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
    return; // It's a void function, so we simply return without returning any value
 #else
    uint32_t converted = (zp[0] << 24) | (zp[1] << 16) | (zp[2] << 8) | zp[3];
    memcpy(zp, &converted, sizeof(converted));
 #endif
 }


This redefined function does specifically what the previous function did, though without solely relying on preprocessor macro (`#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)`) for block execution by logically rearranging the condition checking. Now, regardless of condition, it evaluates and assigns integers obtained from logical bit-shift operations to the `zp` array, and only then checks for the `BTC_BIGENDIAN` macro conditions. If the marco is not defined, a reversal order will be applied with bitmasking & left bit shift conversion.
