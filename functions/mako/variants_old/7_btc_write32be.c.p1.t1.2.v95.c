The C code provided has the aim of writing a 32-bit integer into a byte buffer in big-endian format, regardless of the machine's native endianness. Without altering its original functionality, a program variant of the same might use the `htonl` (HostToNetworkLong) function. This function transfers a long from the host byte order to network order, and hence, irrespective of the host order, the network order defaults to big-endian:

Here is how the function can be given a variant meeting the specification: 


void btc_write32be(uint8_t *zp, uint32_t x) {
  uint32_t big_endian_number = htonl(x);
  memcpy(zp, &big_endian_number, sizeof(big_endian_number));
}


In this new variant, first, the 32-bit number is converted to a big-endian format with the `htonl` function. Then `memcpy` is used to copy the representation `sizeof(uint32_t)` bytes from the address of the 32 bit, big-endian ordered data into the buffer. This behaves the same as the original function.
