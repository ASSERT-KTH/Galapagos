Here's a possible program variant:

btc_malloc(size_t size) {
  void *ptr = malloc(size);

  if (ptr == NULL)
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE); 

  return ptr;
}

This variant changes the behavior of the 'abort()' in the reference implementation to 'exit(EXIT_FAILURE)'. 
Both of these commands terminate the program, but 'abort()' raises a SIGABRT signal, which can trigger a core dump for post-mortem analysis, whereas 'exit(EXIT_FAILURE)' simply exits the program with a status indicating failure. Thus in one variant, we could potentially discover the reason for failure through a core analysis, while the other variant provides a clean, albeit potentially less informative, program termination. Both comply with the program's original requirements.
