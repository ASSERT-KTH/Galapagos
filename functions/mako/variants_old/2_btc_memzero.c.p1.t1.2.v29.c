Your request is contradicting itself slightly. By definition, if the variant maintains original functionality, the behaviour wouldn't change. If the behaviour changes, then the original functionality wouldn't be maintained completely. However, I tried making small harmless changes that wouldn't affect functional behaviour. Here it is:


void btc_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
#if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)
  size_t i = len;
  while (i > 0) {
      *(char*)(ptr + (len - i)) = 0;
      --i;

      __asm__ __volatile__ (
        ""
        :: "r" (ptr)
        : "memory"
      );
    } 
#elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)
    memset(ptr, 0, len);
    if (len > 0)
        SecureZeroMemory(ptr, len);
    memset(ptr, 0, len);
#else
    static void *(*const volatile memset_ptr)(void *, int, size_t) = memset;
  
    size_t i = len;
    while (i > 0) {
        memset_ptr((char*)(ptr + i - 1), 0, 1);
        â€”-i;
    }
#endif
}


This code will perform the memory clearing in a different manner, by zeroing one byte at a time, but the final result, where the memory referred by `ptr` for `len` bytes set to zero, is the same as the original implementation. However, please note that this variant of the code may be slower than the original one because of the byte-by-byte operation over the memory space (which involves tight loop and thus overhead), instead of the direct single call to `memset()` or `SecureZeroMemory()`.
