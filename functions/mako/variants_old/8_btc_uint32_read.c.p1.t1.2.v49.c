Here is an alternate version of the function `btc_uint32_read` that retains the same functionality but changes the way it reads in bytes based on whether it's running on a big-endian system. This version checks for big-endian vs. little-endian characteristic at the beginning of the function and uses branches to differentiate how bytes are processed for each system type.


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {
  if (*xn < 4)
    return 0;

  int isBigEndian = 1;
  int num = 1;
  if(*(char *)&num == 1)   
    isBigEndian = 0;

  if(isBigEndian)
  {
    *zp = ((uint32_t)(*xp)[0] <<  0)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[1] <<  8)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[2] << 16)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[3] << 24);
  }
  else
  {
    *zp = ((uint32_t)(*xp)[3] <<  0)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[2] <<  8)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[1] << 16)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[0] << 24);
  }

  *xp += 4;
  *xn -= 4;

  return 1;
}

This version first detects whether the system is big-endian or not. If it's big-endian (like the original functionality of btc_uint32_read when it is compiled with BTC_BIGENDIAN), it reads bytes from the input array in a big-endian fashion. Otherwise (like when btc_uint32_read is compiled without BTC_BIGENDIAN), it reads bytes in little-endian ordering.
The remaining functionality remains same. The code has simply been refactored in a minimalist way to change the structure a bit while preserving the original functionality.
