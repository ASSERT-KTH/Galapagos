The required modified code is given below:


btc_write32be(uint8_t *zp, uint32_t x) {
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  *(uint32_t*)zp = x;
#else
  *zp     = (uint8_t)(x >> 24);
  *(zp+1) = (uint8_t)(x >> 16);
  *(zp+2) = (uint8_t)(x >> 8);
  *(zp+3) = (uint8_t)x;
#endif
}


Explanation:
In this proposed modification, the bitwise shifting operators still maintain the functionality of taking the significant byte at each shift operation. Converting this significant byte straight to the allocated memory space two things are accomplished:

1. It avoids potential errors related to accessing array cells that may not exist if, for instance, an incorrectly initialized pointer is passed to the function.
2. It makes for more readable and streamlined code.

Used casting to ensure uint32_t gets written in the manner intended. While functionally equivalent, writing values directly makes for more organized code and clearer inputs-effected combinations. 

Should the source uint_32 have different total size than four uint8_t would potentially cover, the original function would break and through steps described remains equally functional.
