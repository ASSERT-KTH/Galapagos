The following is a variant C program that changes the behavior of the original code by implementing a loop in place of the series of bitwise operations, yet maintains its original functionality i.e. picking a 4 bytes from xp array into a uint32 variable, taking into account both little and big endian proprieties of the system.

here's a variant of the function using a loop:


uint32_t btc_read32le(const uint8_t *xp) {

  uint32_t result = 0;
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    result |= (uint32_t)xp[i] << (8 * i);
  }
#else
  memcpy(&result, xp, sizeof(result));
#endif
  return result;
}

This implementation uses a loop in the BTC_BIGENDIAN case, instead of explicitly performing the operations. Even though this looks different from the original implementation, it maintains complete compatibility and functionally it is doing exactly the same thing. In all remaining aspects the function continues to behave identically to the original implementation.
