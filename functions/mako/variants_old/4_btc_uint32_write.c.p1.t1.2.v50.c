The modified codes both do the same action of placing a given 32-bit unsigned integer into an 8-bit integer array pointer in big-endian order. The difference is mainly in code clarity and in handling the pointer to handle/maintain pointer into memory. Based on the provided original logic, initial codes presuppose that the coder is familiar with pointer increment (++ operator) usage (zp++). But to enhance readability for developers unfamiliar with pointer operation, an existent factor that clarifies every intended step is introduced - maintaining original functionality but altering the strategy of handling behavior. Minor clean up of unnecessitated casting to indicate clearly where data may lose values as the data moves from a larger type to a smaller type: from uint32_t to uint8_t in both clauses.
