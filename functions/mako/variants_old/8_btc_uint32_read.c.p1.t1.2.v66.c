Here is a variant of the original source code which maintains the function's signature and functionality:


uint32_t btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {
  if (*xn < sizeof(uint32_t))
    return 0;

  uint32_t val = 0;

#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  val = (*xp)[0];
  val |= (*xp)[1] << 8;
  val |= (*xp)[2] << 16;
  val |= (*xp)[3] << 24;
#else
  memcpy(&val, *xp, sizeof(val));
#endif

  *zp = val;
  *xp += sizeof(uint32_t);
  *xn -= sizeof(uint32_t);

  return 1;
}


This variant preserves the function's original functionality. It first verifies whether the remaining input byte stream contains sufficient bytes. If sufficient bytes are present, it will either perform a bitwise operation (in big endian settings) or copy raw data (in non-big endian settings) to get a 32-bit value. This 32-bit value is then stored into `*zp` and the input pointers *xp and *xn are updated. The function then returns 1 on success.
