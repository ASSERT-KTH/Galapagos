A function that retains its original functionality but implements it differently may use a reference method to mimic the operation of the reference function. For instance:


uint32_t btc_read32le(const uint8_t *xp) {
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  uint32_t ret = 0;
  int shift_bytes = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(uint32_t); i++)
  {
    ret |= (uint32_t)(xp[i]) << shift_bytes;
    shift_bytes += 8;
  }
  
  return ret;
#else
  uint32_t z;
  for(int i=0; i<sizeof(z); i++)
  {
    ((uint8_t*)&z)[i] = xp[i];
  }

  return z;
#endif
}


Under the `#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)` section, we employ a for loop to bit-shift bytes (8 bits by default in C) to the left in increments, and then use the or-left (|=) operator to store the resulting 32 bits into variable ret. The implementation in the `#else` section safeguards against issues arising from aliasing.

This program variant, while structurally distinct methodical in how it processes the bytes compared to the original implementation, yields the same output. The `(uint8_t*)&z)[i] = xp[i]` technique used is a manual byte copying method which serves to mimic the original C's memcpy() standard library function.
