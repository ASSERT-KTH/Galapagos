Here is a variant of the original C function. In this variant, the function `btc_memzero` first checks whether the size `len` is greater than 0 and only then defines its behaviors specific to certain conditions. This rearrangement help avoid unnecessary checks and constraints for function variants that would function on lengths 0 and below i.e., invalid file sizes.


void btc_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
  if (len > 0) {
#if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)
    memset(ptr, 0, len);

    __asm__ __volatile__ (
      ""
      :: "r" (ptr)
      : "memory"
    );
#elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)
    SecureZeroMemory(ptr, len);
#else
    static void *(*const volatile memset_ptr)(void *, int, size_t) = memset;

    memset_ptr(ptr, 0, len);
#endif
  }
}

First, the function checks whether the length `len` is greater than 0. Only then it follows to define and impose constraints specific to different macro environmental flags such as `BTC_HAVE_ASM` and `_WIN32`. Emergently, the new function maintains the core program's behavior from the original function, yet minimizing runs sequence where unnecessary. This becomes particularly important where specific environment conditions `(BTC_HAVE_ASM, _WIN32, etc.)` may not necessarily been guaranteed yet, while the `len > 0` condition would still impose memory storing operations which might not necessarily be executed.
