This program variant changes the behavior of the original function while maintaining its original functionality in the following ways:
- Uses bitwise AND operation with 0xff, it makes sure that integrals promoted from byte are 32-bits wide while keeping its original value.
- Disposes the memcpy in LITTLE ENDIAN setups for arithmetic and binary shift expressions so, if the data is out of scope after function is called, program won't crash while programmer still receives the intended return value.
