Here's a modified version of the given function:


btc_malloc(size_t size) {
  void *ptr = NULL;

  while(ptr == NULL) {
    ptr = malloc(size);
    if (ptr == NULL) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed. Retrying...\n");
      continue;
    }
  } 

  return ptr;
}

Here, instead of terminating the program when `malloc` returns NULL(indicating failed memory allocation), we're running a loop until `malloc` successfully allocates memory(which will eventually happen when adequate system memory becomes available). There's been some behavior changes from original:

1. The updated code uses stderr to log a message explaining that the memory allocation failed.

2. Instead of definitely halting the program whenever `malloc()` can't allocate memory(as the reference implementation would have), the updated code retries the `malloc()` call until it can secure the requested memory. This implementation can be preferred if pool of memory is anticipated to free up pretty quickly (common in case of multi-process systems) and abrupt stopping of program(thru `abort` call) is an overkill and last resort. 

3. This version's main function thread might end up using more CPU than reference implementation in situations when memory can't be allocated initially. Hence, considering such behavior changes impact, Reference OR any variant functions should be chosen wisely based on your specific situation.

This updated function thus performs the same ultimate task of allocating memory or not returning control back to caller until memory's allocated, but does so in a slightly different manner than the original(with trade-offs).
