Your request is a bit ambiguous as you ask to change the behavior while maintaining the original functionality. If the functionality is to remain the same, the change must be minimal. I'll provide a version that incorporates a logging mechanism, allowing for easier debugging while maintaining the original function's objective.

Here is a variant:


#include <stdio.h>

btc_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
  printf("Setting %u bytes of memory to zero.\n", len); // log information

#if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)
  if (len > 0) 
  {
    memset(ptr, 0, len);

    __asm__ __volatile__ (
      ""
      :: "r" (ptr)
      : "memory"
    );
  }
#elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)
  if (len > 0) 
    SecureZeroMemory(ptr, len);
#else
  static void *(*const volatile memset_ptr)(void *, int, size_t) = memset;

  if (len > 0)
    memset_ptr(ptr, 0, len);
#endif
  
  printf("Memset action complete.\n");
}


This program variant simply adds some debugging (print) statements. It displays a message before and after the memory-writing operation, which could potentially aid debugging or clarity about what the function is doing at runtime. Note that this does change the behavior - the function no longer just memsets, but also prints - but it's the most minor behavioral change that still maintains original functionality I could conceive based on your prompt. Please let me know if this is what you were looking for or if you need a somewhat different variant.
