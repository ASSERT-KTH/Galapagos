Hereâ€™s a way to modify the above code that it continues to implement the same functionality with a changed internal structure:


#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void* ldb_malloc(size_t size) {
    void *ptr;
    
    if(!(ptr = malloc(size))) {
        // Handle null pointer allocation by closing the program
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    return ptr;
}

In this variant, the malloc allocation is directly checked in the conditional statement of the 'if'. If malloc fails, the program will directly exit with a failure status code. This variant retains all the functionality of the original function but changes its behavior and structure.
