Here's a program variant that maintains the original functionality but rearranges the code slightly for a different structure:


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {

  if (*xn >= 4) {
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
    *zp = ((*xp)[0] 
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[1] << 8) 
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[2] << 16) 
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[3] << 24));
#else
    memcpy(zp, *xp, sizeof(*zp));
#endif
    *xp += sizeof(*zp);
    *xn -= sizeof(*zp);
    
    return 1;
  } 
  return 0;
}

In this variant, the initial condition checks for >= 4 instead of < 4, negating the need for an early return. This version continues to use the `sizeof(*zp)` macro in case `zp`'s type were to change in the future, offering a bit more flexibility. The main functionality of converting a byte string into a UINT32 value, while accounting for differing endianness, remains the same.
