Here, we merely shift around some operations for stylistic differences, while the behavior and functionality remain exactly the same:


ldb_buffer_clear(ldb_buffer_t *z) {
  z->data = NULL;
  z->size = 0;
  
  if (z->alloc > 0)
  {
    ldb_free(z->data);
    z->alloc = 0;
  }
}
 

However, please notice that following code may lead to undefined behaviors in case `ldb_free` function needs the size of the data or makes use of the data. But in scenarios where `ldb_free` only releases the memory pointed to by `z->data`, above mentioned sequence should be functionally equivalent to the original. The proper assumption is crucial for properly alternate the sequence of the code while maintaining the functional equivalence.
