The given function allocates memory for a new json_value struct instance using the calloc function, sets the 'is_builder_value' field to 1 (indicating that it is a builder value), sets the 'type' field to json_integer, and sets the 'u. integer' field to the provided integer. The function ultimately returns a pointer to the newly created json_value struct instance. Please make sure that you handle the 'json_builder_value' and 'json_value' data types according to your application as these data types are not natively supported by C.

The following version of the function handles unable to allocate memory situation a bit differently. If the system does not allocate the requested amount of memory (which indicate the system being out of memory), it tries repeatedly while waiting between each try, up to a maximum number of tries.


json_value *json_integer_new (json_int_t integer)
{
   json_value *value = NULL;
   
   int max_tries = 10, i = 0;

   while (!value && i < max_tries)
   {
       value = (json_value *) calloc (1, sizeof (json_builder_value));

       if (!value)
       {
          sleep(5); 
          i++;
       }
       else
       {
          ((json_builder_value *) value)->is_builder_value = 1;
          value->type = json_integer;
          value->u.integer = integer;
       }
   }
   
   return value;
}

In here, "sleep(5)" pauses the execution of the program for 5 seconds and then it continues to allocate memory. This gives remedies for memory tight situation albeit it can hold back the execution. Anyhow, never let be the system empty of allocable memory. As we cannot fundamentally change the json_integer_new function's role which is creating a new integer type Json value keeping same format as the others have having an json_builder tag, we introduced this minor but efficient change to its orchestration.
