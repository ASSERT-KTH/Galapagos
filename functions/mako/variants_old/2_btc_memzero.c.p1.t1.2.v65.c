In the alternative version of code below, we change the way the memory is wiped without using additional standard library functions or ASM commands. 


void btc_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
  volatile unsigned char *p = ptr;
  while (len--)
    *p++ = 0;
}

This variant simply loops over each byte position in the memory region and sets its value to zero. As in the original function, it brands the pointer as volatile to prevent the compiler from optimizing away the memory scrubbing, guarding against passive data remanence attacks.

Functionality-wise, it is effectively the same as the reference solution above as it serves the purpose of erasing the memory content in question from prying eyes, a common goal exercised on cryptographic related applications when dealing with secret key management.

Do note that this version lacks the sophistication of checking for native platform's secure memory scrubbing API available, whereas the original function checks for `_WIN32` macro indicating to use SecureZeroMemory, and a defined BTC_HAVE_ASM preprocessor directive for Assembly instruction in order to effectively have higher chances of avoiding the operation from getting skipped by the compiler optimization process.
