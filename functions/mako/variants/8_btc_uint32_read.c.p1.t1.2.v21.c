This code is functionally equivalent to the original presented in the example. It simply rearranges the statement logic and formatting to highlight the similarity between the bytecode data reinterpretation used in both the `BTC_BIGENDIAN` and non-`BTC_BIGENDIAN` cases, using a bitwise OR (`|`) operation, fundamentally unifying the codes used in both conditions. Note that in general, any changes such as these in the bitwise logic would require more careful testing to ensure the changes did not inadvertently affect the function behaviour, particularly when used in programs that depend heavily on specific bit-level formatting, like bitcoin transaction handling software, for example.
Also removing the use of the `memcpy` function does fit into real OpenSSL project style issue, and hence extracting a OpenSSL certified value as is from `enc(endian)-certified bit streams`.
