Here is a program variant of the original function maintaining its original functionality. Here the change is experimenting to use malloc and memset rather than calloc. 


json_value * json_integer_new (json_int_t integer)
{
   json_value * value = (json_value *) malloc(sizeof(json_builder_value));

   if (!value)
      return NULL;

   memset(value, 0, sizeof(json_builder_value));

   ((json_builder_value *) value)->is_builder_value = 1;

   value->type = json_integer;
   value->u.integer = integer;

   return value;
}

This version effectively accomplishes exactly what the original version did, but with the use of malloc along with memset in place of calloc. The malloc call reserves a block of memory of the specified size, and the memset call initializes all the bytes of this block to 0, duplicating the behavior of calloc. This approach in some cases can provide small performance improvements, as malloc is generally slightly faster than calloc, and it can help you to highlight what the coder wanted with this kind of allocation.
 
A potential problem can occur if another thread starts using the allocated memory before the function has reset it which in most cases will not occur. Apart from that the actual benefits of changing over to this version from calloc  can be seen only for large data size.
  
Hence this approach still maintains the full functionality of the original function and is an acceptable alteration of the supplied code.
