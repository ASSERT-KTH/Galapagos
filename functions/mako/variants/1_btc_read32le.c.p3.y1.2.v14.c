go
package main

import (
	"encoding/binary"
)

func btc_read32le(xp []byte) uint32 {
	return binary.LittleEndian.Uint32(xp)
}

The code above uses the "encoding/binary" package's function "LittleEndian.Uint32" to produce a semantically equivalent version of the btc_read32le function in Go. The xp argument is of the []byte type in the Go function because the C code uses the uint8_t * type which represents an array of 8-bit integers (bytes in Go). This function will read a 32-bit little endian integer from the offset 0 of the byte slice.

In this implementation, assuming that the xp argument may not point to valid, sequentially located bytes could amount to undefined behavior. Therefore, I am not checking for an "index out of range" kind of error in this specific Go code. 

If error checking should be performed and xp isn't guaranteed to have enough data (i.e., e >= 4), error handling should be applied which would modify the function signature from the C version.
