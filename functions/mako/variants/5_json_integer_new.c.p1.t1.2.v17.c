Here's a program variant that changes the behavior but maintains the original functionality. The difference in behavior is that it firstly zeroes out all bytes in the allocated structure explicitly using ``memset()`` after allocation, before doing the assignment operations on the memory area allocated by calloc() (which actually does return zeroed memory), just to avoid unlikely cases where the memory was not properly cleaned for some reason.


#include <string.h> // For memset function, added at the start

json_value * json_integer_new (json_int_t integer)
{
   json_value * value = (json_value *) calloc (1, sizeof (json_builder_value));

   if (!value)
      return NULL;

   //  Explicit zeroing-out
   memset(value, 0, sizeof(json_builder_value));

   ((json_builder_value *) value)->is_builder_value = 1;

   value->type = json_integer;
   value->u.integer = integer;

   return value;
}
 

Remember that doing this "memset" is essentially redundant (because calloc already zero-initializes the memory), presents a possible performance concern and only really serves as coverage in cases where data integrity could be questioned - such as on an embedded or otherwise constrained system. Therefore, in almost all cases this change should be regarded as unnecessary, but it does keep the core function intact and adds an extra behavior.
