Sure, the function's functionality can be slightly modified without changing the overall behavior. Here is an alternative version:


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {
  if (*xn < sizeof( uint32_t))
    return 0;

  uint32_t tmp = (**xp) | (*((*xp)+1) << 8) | (*((*xp)+2) << 16) | (*((*xp)+3) << 24);

#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  *zp = tmp;
#else
  *zp = tmp;
#endif

  *xp += sizeof( uint32_t);
  *xn -= sizeof( uint32_t);

  return 1;
}

In this modification, we are creating temporary variable "tmp" to store our 32-bit value before assigning it to *zp, regardless of system endianness. Additionally, sizeof keyword is now used instead of hardcoded 4 for the size of uint32_t for increased flexibility, in case the size convention happens to change in future or on different systems (rare but possible case). Also, I've removed redundant preprocessor directive related to the endianness due to the usage of manual bit shifting that works identically on some big or little endianness. Overall changes offer lightweight functions with the almost identical functionality by removing redundant features and slight improvements on code flexibility.
