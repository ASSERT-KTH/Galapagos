Sure, this variant doesn't change the functionality but alters the way the functions perform tasks. In this variant, the copy operation within the loop and the operations to adjust the pointers and size are interchanged.


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {
    if (*xn < 4)
        return 0;

    *xp += 4;
    *xn -= 4;

#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
    *zp = ((uint32_t)(*xp)[-4] << 0)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[-3] << 8)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[-2] << 16)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[-1] << 24);
#else
    memcpy(zp, (*xp)-4, sizeof(*zp));
#endif

    return 1;
}


This variant starts by advancing the reader position (`*xp`) as soon as it checks whether there are at least four in buffer (`*xn`). This variant moves these two operations to the top of the function (as after check whether it can perform these operations or no). Remember that `*xp` points to the next byte to consume, not the currently consuming byte. More importantly, TCP ends up working with the same four bytes of input data as before accepting change behaviour while keeping functionality the same.
