Here is a program variant where we include some format of error logging without changing the actual functionality:


#include <stdio.h>
btc_free(void *ptr) {
  if (ptr == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Attempted to free NULL pointer.Exiting...");
    abort(); 
  } else {
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
  }
}


In this example, when a `NULL` pointer is passed to `btc_free`, a message will be logged to the standard error indicating the reason for the program aborting. Addition of `ptr = NULL;` after `free(ptr);` ensures that a dangling pointer (to deallocated memory) is avoided; this idiom can contribute to safer and more maintainable C code.
