Here's a variant of the program that changes the behavior by introducing a retry in case the attempt to allocate memory fails. It will attempt allocation up to three times before aborting.


#include <unistd.h>

void* ldb_malloc(size_t size) {
  void *ptr = NULL;
  int num_tries = 0;
  
  while (ptr == NULL && num_tries < 3) {
    ptr = malloc(size);
    num_tries++;
    
    if (ptr == NULL)
      sleep(1); // wait before the next attempt
  }
  
  if (ptr == NULL) 
    abort();

  return ptr;
}


This variant retries allocation in case the first attempt fails, adding robustness in cases where a momentary lack of available memory might prevent allocation. Please note that this only works because malloc is a non-blocking function - it doesn't wait until memory becomes available. Rather, it returns a null pointer if it can't satisfy the request immediately. Pausing before retrying can allow other processes to free up memory.
