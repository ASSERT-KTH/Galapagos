This variant changes the behavior of the original function, but still meets its original functionality.
The original function returns a value indicating whether the function was successful or not. In the variant, the same is signaled to the caller by setting the `*zp` pointer to `0` when the function fails.

The original function reads the 4 bytes directly via memcpy considering that it runs in a little-endian system. Nevertheless, and doing it in a bit-by-bit way is safer and we could leverage a local structure `endianness_conv` for this purpose. Inside this union, There is a 32-bit word 'dw' that overlays 4 bytes 'b[4]'. This allows converting a sequence of 4 bytes into a 32-bit word without risking any kind of incompatibility or undefined behavior regardless of architecture's endianness.
