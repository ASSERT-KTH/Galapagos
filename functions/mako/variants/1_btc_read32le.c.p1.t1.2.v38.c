The function given is responsible for handling 'Bignum Encoding' related functionality like translating byte code as per endianness.

Here is another version which meets the original behaviour but with a slight change in implementation:

#include <stdint.h>

uint32_t btc_read32le(const uint8_t *xp) {
    uint32_t res = 0x0;
    unsigned char converArr[sizeof(uint32_t)];
 
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
    for(int i=sizeof(uint32_t)-1; i>=0; i--)
    {
        res <<= 8;
        res |= (uint32_t)xp[i];
    }
#else

    // With this technique, effectively the bytes are copied in reverse order because that's how memcpy works to match system endianness.
    for(int i=0; i<sizeof(uint32_t); i++)
    {
        converArr[i] = xp[sizeof(uint32_t)-i-1];
    }
    memcpy(&res,xp, sizeof(uint32_t));
#endif
    return res;
}

This program applies the same operation as the first one but uses a loop structure instead of individual bitwise OR operations. We then use that integer value, shifting each byte to its proper position and OR'ing it into the result. The memcpy operation to match system endianness is also wrapped inside a loop to avoid direzt pointer bytes copying, in synergy with the big endian loop for bytes order handling. It still effectively keeps the btc_read32le's basic functionality and intended its behaviour.
