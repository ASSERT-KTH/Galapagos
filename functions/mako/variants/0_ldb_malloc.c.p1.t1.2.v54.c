Here's a variant of the original function ldb_malloc. The functionality remains unchanged. The variation introduced involves using the stderr stream to convey a message about operation failure, offering more of an explanation about what went wrong.


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void* ldb_malloc(size_t size) {
  void *ptr = malloc(size);

  if (ptr == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed!\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  return ptr;
}


Here, fprintf allows us to specify exactly which stream we want to send our message to, in this case, stderr â€“ the OS's standard error mechanism, ideal for reporting on operational errors. After logging our message, we immediately end the process via exit, using the EXIT_FAILURE macro to signify that something didn't go as planned. We don't provide stream flushing because it's provided by the stdlib when any active processes are taught to halt execution.
