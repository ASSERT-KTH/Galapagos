Your task could be possibly misunderstood due to conflicting requirements, which seems like you're asking for behavior change (which affects functionality) yet keeping the original functionality. However, if you mean to rewrite the function without altering the function's logic or behavior, here how it gets:


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {
  if (*xn >= 4) {
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
    *zp = ((uint32_t)(*xp)[0] <<  0)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[1] <<  8)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[2] << 16)
        | ((uint32_t)(*xp)[3] << 24);
#else
    memcpy(zp, *xp, sizeof(*zp));
#endif

    *xp += 4;
    *xn -= 4;

    return 1;
  } 
  return 0;
}


In this Version, I've inlined the initial condition. If the condition not met, it'll directly return 0 without executing the rest. Similar behaviour can be provided through another control statement without touching its original functionality. Here, undivided responsibility of the function regulation (return 1 or 0) could be easily seen in the rewritten version contrary to the original one where flow is divided.
