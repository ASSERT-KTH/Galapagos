Here is a program variant that increases the flexibility of the original function btc_memzero via an additional parameter, 'value', which defines the value to set the memory to. Essentially, instead of fixing memset's value parameter to only zero, this variation allows any desired value to override the memory blocks pointing by the pointer 'ptr'. Despite the enhanced flexibility, it also maintains its original functionality since setting 'value' to '0' replicates the function's previous behavior.


void btc_memset(void *ptr, size_t len, int value) {
#if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)
  if (len > 0) {
    memset(ptr, value, len);

    __asm__ __volatile__ (
      ""
      :: "r" (ptr)
      : "memory"
    );
  }
#elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)
  if (len > 0) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      ((unsigned char*)ptr)[i] = value;
    }
  } 
#else
  static void *(*const volatile memset_ptr)(void *, int, size_t) = memset;

  if (len > 0)
    memset_ptr(ptr, value, len);
#endif
}


In this version, 'value' can be set to '0' to mimic the behavior of the original function.
This adaptation aims to offer the integrity and versatility of 'btc_memzero' while compensating for the one particular way its design might be a limiting perspective â€“ different developers/users might prefer/benefit from this configurable function.
Be noted, though the signature is now different, it offers similar performance with potential application in a wider array of situations.
