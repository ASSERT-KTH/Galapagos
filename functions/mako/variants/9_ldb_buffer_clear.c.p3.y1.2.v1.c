Assuming `LDBBuffer` in Go is represented as:

Go
type LDBBuffer struct {
    data  []byte
    size  int
    alloc int
}


Then the equivalent function could be:

Go
func LDBBufferClear(z *LDBBuffer) {
    if z.alloc > 0 {
        z.data = nil
    }

    z.size = 0
    z.alloc = 0
}


Note that there is explicitly no `free` function for slices in Go as the garbage collector takes care of memory management. Once no references to a slice exist, its memory will be freed. Therefore, setting `z.data` to `nil` effectively prepares the underlying memory to be freed.
