Here's a code variant that slightly modifies the behavior of the original function. In this new variant, the program will safely exit with a status of 1 if a NULL pointer is passed, rather than aborting the whole system abruptly.


#include <stdlib.h> /* To include free() and exit() */

void btc_free(void *ptr) {
  if (ptr == NULL) {
    /* Exit program with status 1 instead of calling abort() */
    exit(1); 
  }

  /* Here, free the allocated memory */
  free(ptr);
}

In the modified function, if a NULL pointer is passed it will still perform a similar function like abort (i.e., the program will terminate), but it does so through the exit call rather than abort. Consequently, while the original functionality (freeing memory and terminating on receiving a NULL pointer) is maintained, the precise behavior has been changed.
