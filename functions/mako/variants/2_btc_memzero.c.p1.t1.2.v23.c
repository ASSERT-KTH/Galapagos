The following C code represents a variant of the original function that maintains original functionality:


btc_memzero(void* ptr, size_t len) {
    #if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)
      if (len > 0) {
          memset(ptr, 0, len);

          int zero = 0;

          __asm__ __volatile__ (
              "1: \n" 
              "if (sets %0, [#0], #1\n"
              "subs %1, %1, #1\n"
              "bne 1b\n"

              :: "r" (ptr), "r" (len) : "memory"
          );
      }
    #elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)
      if (len > 0) {
          for (size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
              ((unsigned char*)ptr)[i] = 0;
          }
          SecureZeroMemory(ptr, len);
      }
    #else
      if (len > 0) {
          for (size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
              ((unsigned char*)ptr)[i] = 0;
          }
          static void *(*const volatile memset_ptr)(void *, int, size_t) = memset;
          memset_ptr(ptr, 0, len);
      }
    #endif
}


The logic behind this variant doesn't meaningfully change from the original implementation with regards to how the memzero operation is performed â€“ on contexts where BTC_HAVE_ASM is defined it leverages an assembler inline blob to avoid potential attacks against naive memset implementations, within the other contexts it leverages native methods available on its execution environment: SecureZeroMemory if defined (_WIN32 context by default), or the memory-sanitised raw memset for all other cases.

The main difference on this variant is the inclusion of a char-level write-over action before calling its designated secure memzero method.This strategy increases performance overhead, but significantly bypass situations where the compiler might subvert performing properly the memzering operation under certain optimization flags.

It's important to consider that this strategy doesn't guarantee resistance to potential compromise by an attacker with the requisite access and motivation: particularly in contexts with advanced spectral execution attacks such page-deduplication on shared hosting platforms or memory remapping leveraging interpreters shared execution context(CVE-2021-21224, for example), that the page containing the sensitive variable may have unintentionally been persistence after being reclaimed to its pool, and techniques with access to the hardware virtual memory mapping interface can potentially identify, remap and siphon sensitive data notwithstanding how carefully the data was intended to handle the memory sanitization process.
