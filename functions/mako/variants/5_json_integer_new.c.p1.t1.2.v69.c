Here is a variant of the function that adds error checking for the calloc allocation. Improvement like this is consistently a reasonable alternative to consider whenever calling allocation functions like calloc(), malloc(), etc. Also value casting of calloc is not necessary in C as it automatically casts void to appropriate pointer type:


json_value * json_integer_new (json_int_t integer)
{
   json_value * value = calloc (1, sizeof (json_builder_value));

   /* improvement explanation comment start: */
   /* Check whether calloc successfully allocated memory or else free it to prevent any potential memory leakage */
   /* improvement explanation comment ends. */

   if (value == NULL)
   {
      fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed!");
      free(value);
      return NULL;
   }

   ((json_builder_value *) value)->is_builder_value = 1;

   value->type = json_integer;
   value->u.integer = integer;

   return value;
}


One should keep in mind that the `fprintf` line is ideal for debugging but should probably be handled differently or logged in a production setting. This is highly dependent on how errors are handled in your system. If the intent of original function is to silently fail on memory allocation issues rather then this improvement should not be applied there.
