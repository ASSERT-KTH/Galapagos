For this version, the conditions for read operation proceed in a different order and all confirmation steps are located at the end of the function, which uses bitwise shifting to produce results equivalent to the original function, without needing implementation libraries. For ease of understanding, the endianness conditional block was also replaced with two separate lines for both endiannesses.


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn)
{
  *xp += 4; /* Proceed to the next four-byte block in the source bytes.*/
  *xn -= 4; /* Deducts size of read bytes from total size. */

  if (*xn < 0) /* Undoes changes if read size is too short, ending function. */
  {
    *xp -= 4; 
    *xn += 4;
    return 0;
  }

#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  *zp = (((*xp)[-4]) | ((*xp)[-3] << 8) | ((*xp)[-2] << 16) |
         ((*xp)[-1] << 24)); /* Fetches four-byte block by reaching backward. */
#else
  *zp = ((*xp)[-1] | ((*xp)[-2] << 8) | ((*xp)[-3] << 16) |
         ((*xp)[-4] << 24)); /* Fetches four-byte block by reaching backward. */
#endif

  return 1;
}

Note: This example assumes that the function can proceed to the next parameters (xp or zp) only when a valid block is read. Try to replace these conditions to the desire of the business flow if it is assumed these actions should happen independently of the success of reading.
