Sure, I can do that. Instead of directly terminating the function when `*xn` is less than 4, I will extend the function to read the bytes available and fill the rest array with zeroes (similar to padding). 

Here is the updated function:


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {
    uint32_t tmp = 0;
  
    for(size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(*zp); i++) {
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
        tmp |= ((*xn > i ? (*xp)[i] : 0) << (i*8));
#else
        tmp |= ((*xn > i ? (*xp)[i] : 0) << ((3-i)*8));
#endif
    }

    *zp = tmp;
  
    size_t advance = *xn < sizeof(*zp) ? *xn : sizeof(*zp);
  
    *xp += advance;
    *xn -= advance;
  
    return advance == sizeof(*zp);
}

In this function, if less than 4 bytes are available to read from *xp, zeros will be applied to the missing bytes. The function will adjust the input pointer and the number of bytes in junction with how many bytes were read, and it will induce true if all four bytes were read, else false. This updated function changes the behavior of the original function but still able to operate the original function.
