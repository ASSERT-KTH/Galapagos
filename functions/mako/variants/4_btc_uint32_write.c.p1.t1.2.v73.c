Here is a variant of the original function that maintains its original functionality:


#include <stdint.h>

uint8_t* btc_uint32_write(uint8_t *zp, uint32_t x) {
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  zp[0] = (x & 0xFF);
  zp[1] = ((x >> 8) & 0xFF);
  zp[2] = ((x >> 16) & 0xFF);
  zp[3] = ((x >> 24) & 0xFF);
#else
  zp[0] = ((x >> 0) & 0xFF);
  zp[1] = ((x >> 8) & 0xFF);
  zp[2] = ((x >> 16) & 0xFF);
  zp[3] = ((x >> 24) & 0xFF);
#endif
  return zp + 4;
}

This variant of the code still writes a 32-bit number to the byte array `zp`. The function begins by checking if the `BTC_BIGENDIAN` macro is defined, which means the architecture uses a big-endian byte order. If it is defined, it writes the number in a way that the most significant byte comes first. If it isn't defined, it will store the bytes in little-endian order, where the position with the lowest address has the least significant byte.

In the changes from original function made here, the positional storing for little and big endian was done deliberately, along with bit masking before shifting the input variable 'x', ensuring actual value of byte is written.
