Here's the modified code:


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {

  if (*xn >= 4) {

    #if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)

      *zp = ((*xp)[0])
          | ((*xp)[1] <<  8)
          | ((*xp)[2] << 16)
          | ((*xp)[3] << 24);

    #else

      for(int i=0; i < sizeof(*zp); i++)
        // copy each byte from source into destination
        *(unsigned char*)(zp+i) = *(*xp+i);

    #endif

    *xp += more_space;

    *xn -= more_space;

  }
  // return 1 (success) only if enough space (xn >= more_space), else 0;
  return *xn >= 4;
}

In this variant, we eliminate the direct return 0 if *xn < 4 instead incorporating the condition into whether the operations within the if block execute or not and return a boolean representing whether the statement `*xn >= 4` is true. With this arrangement, we can eliminate the preliminary returns mid-function.
Also, the memcpy() function used has been replaced with a manual byte-by-byte copying via a for loop. The functionality remains same as memcpy, but gives an understanding on a manual method to achieve the same output.
These ensures we maintain the original functionality while slightly adjusting the behavior of the code.
