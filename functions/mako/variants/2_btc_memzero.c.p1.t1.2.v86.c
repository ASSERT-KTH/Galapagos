The task implies to create a variant of the given function maintaining the business logic (its functionality) as it is, implying doing something more/less over the existing implementation without ruining the original functionality.

Here's one way to create such a variant: by adding error handling mechanism, which doesn't exist in the original function. A pointer passed in 'ptr' could be a null pointer, which isn't problematized in the original version, leading to potential issues.


btc_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
  
  // if null pointer is provided.  
  if(ptr == NULL)
    return;

#if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)
  if (len > 0) {
    memset(ptr, 0, len);

    __asm__ __volatile__ (
      ""
      :: "r" (ptr)
      : "memory"
    );
  }
#elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)
  if (len > 0)
    SecureZeroMemory(ptr, len);
#else
  static void *(*const volatile memset_ptr)(void *, int, size_t) = memset;

  if (len > 0)
    memset_ptr(ptr, 0, len);
#endif
}

The condition added at the start of function will save time and resources in the cases where pointer to clear is not initialized(Null), thus program doesn't waste time for layouting whether to use which clearing(ASM, SecureZeroMemory or Memset) method it should use. It will return immediately in such scenerio. This might have a little memory saving impact in concurrent tasks.
