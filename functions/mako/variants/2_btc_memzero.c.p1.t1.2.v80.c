Here is a code variant that utilizes a for loop to manually zero out the memory region while bypassing possible compiler optimizations by assigning the helper volatile char*. This retains the functionality of the original function while also altering the implementation slightly.


#include <stddef.h>

void btc_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
   #if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)
   if(len > 0) {
      memset(ptr, 0, len);

     __asm__ __volatile__ (
       ""
       :: "r" (ptr)
       : "memory"
     );
   }
   #elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)
      if(len > 0)
         SecureZeroMemory(ptr, len);
   #else
      char* p = (char*) ptr;
      volatile char* vp = p;
      if(len > 0) {
         while(len--) *vp++ = 0;
      }
   #endif 
}


This variant of function uses a for loop specifically made to handle byte-level operations. In some systems, a dedicated function such as memset or SecureZeroMemory is more optimized, but in general, a direct for loop set with volatile-char* pointer would prevent most compiler optimizations and be an all-rounded solution for all systems. Use this with knowledge allowing compiler optimizations if purposefully turned off.
