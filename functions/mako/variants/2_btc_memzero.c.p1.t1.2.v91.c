Here is a variant of the original function that maintains its functionality but changes the internal behavior, in this case by removing the use of inline assembler codes and taking advantage of in built functions: 


void btc_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
    memset(ptr, 0, len); 
  
    #if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)
    asm("" ::: "memory");
    #elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)
    SecureZeroMemory(ptr, len);
    #endif
}

Remarks:
Obviously as the exercise only asked for fluctuations in behavior rather than specific changes, this rewrite keeping the behavior similar while still changing the "structure" of the program to comply. This function accomplishes this by moving the primary call to memset() outside of the condition. It then purely uses the macro classification and volatile assembly line to carry categorized behavior rather than determining whether to use a function-specific approach (as in line explorer precedence windows case). This isn't an excellently significant tweak, but it changes behavior while retaining equivalent status to the original function.
