Here's a slightly different variation of the function that maintains the algorithm's functionality:


void btc_write32be(uint8_t *zp, uint32_t x) {
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
   *zp++ = x >> 24;
   *zp++ = x >> 16;
   *zp++ = x >> 8;
   *zp = x;
#else
   *zp++ = (x >> 24) & 0xFF;
   *zp++ = (x >> 16) & 0xFF;
   *zp++ = (x >> 8) & 0xFF;
   *zp = x & 0xFF;
#endif
}


In this variant, I've used the unary increment operator to move to the next byte on the `zp` array after writing each byte of `x` to `zp`. This technique can make the code slightly faster to execute on certain hardware architectures due to the compiler optimizing the code for performance. 

The changes maintain the original functionality because, regardless of the defined `BTC_BIGENDIAN`, the bytes from `x` are still written to `zp` in the highest-to-lowest order of significant bytes from `x`. The `(x >> Y) & 0xFF` ensures that only the byte that's being worked with is extracted from `x` in little-endian systems. It essentially filters out the upper bytes to clean the byte being handled from any data residue. It should be noted that this operation may slightly slow down the execution on little-endian systems.
