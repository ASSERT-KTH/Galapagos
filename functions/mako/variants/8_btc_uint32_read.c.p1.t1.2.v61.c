Here's an equivalent variant of the provided function:


btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn) {
  if (*xn < 4)
    return 0;
  
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  uint32_t val = 0;
  for(int i=0; i < 4; ++i) {
     val |= (uint32_t)(*xp)[i] << 8*i;
  }
  *zp = val;
#else
  for(int i=0; i < 4; ++i) {
     ((uint8_t*)zp)[i] = (*xp)[i];
  }
#endif

  *xp += 4;
  *xn -= 4;

  return 1;
}

This code does exactly what the original function does but employs a loop to conduct the process - thereby illustrating another manner of implementing the same feature. In this `#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)` condition, it shifts each byte to its correct position in the `val` variable rather than doing all the shifts in one operation. In the `#else` condition, it proceeds byte by byte to copy from `*xp` to `*zp` instead of using `memcpy`.
