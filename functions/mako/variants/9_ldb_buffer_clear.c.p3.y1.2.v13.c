For equivalence in the Go language, given that `ldb_free` is essentially a de-allocation of memory, Go's garbage collector should manage it without explicit indication. Essentially `z.data = nil` has the same effect.

func ldbBufferClear(z *ldbBuffer) {
    if z.alloc > 0 {
        z.data = nil
    }

    z.size = 0
    z.alloc = 0
}
