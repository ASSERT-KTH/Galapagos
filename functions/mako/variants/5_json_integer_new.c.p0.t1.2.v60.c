Program variations can include the insertion of sanity checks, removal of implicit type casting, additional error handling, implementation of additional but not mandatory features and the formatting.

Here it's showed a program variant using slightly different error handling and adds a check to validate if the passed integer is a valid JSON integer:

This version includes a check to ensure that 'integer' does not exceed the maximum allowable size of a JSON integer (inside 'JSON_INT_MAX'). If it does exceed this limit, NULL is returned.

It also restructures the malloc/calloc error checking. Rather than immediately returning NULL if the calloc operation fails, it prints to stderr, draws back the stack and then lets the function naturally return NULL.


json_value * json_integer_new(json_int_t integer)
{
    if (integer > JSON_INT_MAX)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "JSON integer is out of range\n");
        return NULL;
    }

    json_value * value = calloc(1, sizeof(json_builder_value));
    json_builder_value * builder_ptr = (json_builder_value *) value;

    if (!value)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to allocate memory for JSON integer\n");
    }
    else
    {
        builder_ptr->is_builder_value = 1;
        builder_ptr->u.integer = integer;
    }

    return value;
}

Note: The subsequent codes that will call this function will require to handle same error cases.

Let me know if you need another version or have question related to the code thrown above.
