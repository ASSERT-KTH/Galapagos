Assuming you have suitable methods available, your Go implementation may look something like this. Please be aware that in an actual program, you may need to manage the reference counter to the underlying array for buffer yourself manually according to gc (garbage collector) regulation implementations:

Go
func (z *ldbBuffer) Clear() {
  if z.alloc > 0 {
    ldbFree(z.data)
  }

  z.data = nil
  z.size = 0
  z.alloc = 0
}


Please be aware this conversion is not straightforward as the malloc and free model of memory managing that exists in C doesn't exist in Go. In the pure Go environment, you maybe can't free memory manually like in C. Garbage Collector (gc) may do the memory recycling instead of your willful alloc, realloc and free. That's actually one of the Go's language design features and conveniences for developers to avoid complex memory managing. We are assuming here that `ldbFree`, which normally frees memory, is some known function or that there is enough implementation for this function to provide alike effect in Go. Under different circumstances, you may need another approach.
