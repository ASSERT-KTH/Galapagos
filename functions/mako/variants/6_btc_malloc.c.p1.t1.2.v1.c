Here's a variant of a program where instead of calling the abort() function when memory allocation fails, it tries to allocate memory repeatedly in a loop for a certain number of times (25 tried in this variant). If allocation still fails after all retries, it returns NULL.

The retry mechanism here can be valuable in certain real-time systems, where failing to allocate memory once does not necessarily mean the system is out of memory, it just could mean there's peak memory-usage at this point, and in the near future there could be less memory usage and `malloc` might succeed.

#include <unistd.h>

void* btc_malloc(size_t size) {
  int retries = 25;
  void *ptr;
  do {
    ptr = malloc(size);

    if (ptr == NULL) {
      sleep(1); /* dally here for a while */
    } else {
      return ptr; /* if successful, we can get out of loop */
    }
  }  while(--retries > 0);
  /* if retries exhausted and still ptr is NULL, return NULL */

  return NULL;
}
 
Please make sure to include necessary header files where this function is defined.
Note that, if some error checking and actions when allocation fails is a mandatory scenario for the software this function would be part of, utilizing this approach might lead to scenarios not detectable until their consequences become problems themselves (silent errors because of "hiding" error). Consider whether to accept such risks in determining the design most appropriate for your software.
