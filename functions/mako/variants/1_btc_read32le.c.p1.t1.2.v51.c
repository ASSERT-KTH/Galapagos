Here is the requested program variant -


btc_read32le(const uint8_t *xp) {
#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)
  uint32_t z = 0;
  for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
  {
     z |= (uint32_t)xp[i] << (i * 8);
  }
  return z;
#else
  union {
    uint8_t xp[4];
    uint32_t z;
  } u;
  
  for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
  {
    u.xp[i] = xp[i];
  }
  
  return u.z;
#endif
}


The bitwise operations and memcpy function tasks have been maintained, replicating the original function's purpose of adjusting for endianess and reading a pointer to a byte array as a 32-bit integer. The memcpy operation has been swapped with a union, which organically permits the behavior held by using of memcpy to directly imply methodology of copying bytes of memory. Other changes include loops to do the bitwise shift-operation and assignment for `BTC_BIGENDIAN` and copying of array values in the `#else` section respectively.
