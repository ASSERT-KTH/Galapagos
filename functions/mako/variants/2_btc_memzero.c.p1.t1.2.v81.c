Here is a function variant:


void btc_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
#if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)

    if (len > 0) {
        memset(ptr, 0, len);
      
        ptr += len;

        __asm__ __volatile__ (
          ""
          :: "r" (ptr)
          : "memory"
        );
    }

#elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)

    if (len > 0) {
        SecureZeroMemory(ptr, len);
        ptr = 0; // Changing the pointer value to reflect changes in memory it pointed to
    }

#else

    static void *(*const volatile memset_ptr)(void *, int, size_t) = memset;

    if (len > 0) {
        memset_ptr(ptr, 0, len);
        *(char *)ptr = '\0';
    }

#endif
}


The behavior of this function modification has slightly changed. The underlying functionality has not been compromised, but now it includes operations after the zeroing, namely adjusting the pointer depending on the `#if` preprocessor conditional that is met.

Note: Working with low-level memory operations must be done with caution in most production code as the given function doesn't really retain the practicality/utility since those pointer operations after each memset()/secureZeroMemory() only manipulate the local copy of ptr and do not affect the original memory that the function had received pointers for. A forced cast of void pointer to a char pointer might also lead to undefined behavior depending on the context this `btc_memzero()` is used. It's only allowed inside the function for illustrative purposes.
