Here is a program variant of the original function:


ldb_buffer_clear(ldb_buffer_t *z) {
  if (!z)
    return;

  if (z->data) {
    ldb_free(z->data);
    z->data = NULL;
  }
  
  z->size = z->alloc = 0;
}

Here we still clear the buffer but with additional null pointer check at the start of the function, which allows for safer usage since calling the clear function with a NULL pointer won't cause a segmentation fault. We also don't check whether `alloc > 0` before freeing `z->data`, since deallocating NULL has no effect and is not an error.
