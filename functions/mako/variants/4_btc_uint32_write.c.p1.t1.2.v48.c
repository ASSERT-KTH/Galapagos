This alternative maintains the same functionality as the original function but manipulates the code structure. It employs loop to standardize the way bits from 'x' are shifted independently of the platform ((i.e., Big-endian)) on which the function is executing on the `#if defined(BTC_BIGENDIAN)` directive. This makes the code more readable and maintainable. The block of code under `#else` also uses loop to copy bits from the input argument 'x' to the memory location pointed to by 'zp'.
