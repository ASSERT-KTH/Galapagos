Your task request isn't exactly clear - you've requested a "program variant that changes the behavior of the original function while maintaining its original functionality". The function btc_memzero as shown in your question zeroes out a block of memory with a certain length given by len. If the function is to keep its original functionality (zeroing memory), the logical behavior you can change is "the condition under which memory clearing is performed". The changed code included extra condition to check if len is very large number.


btc_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
#if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)
  if (len > 0 && len < 10000000) {
    memset(ptr, 0, len);

    __asm__ __volatile__ (
      ""
      :: "r" (ptr)
      : "memory"
    );
  }
#elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)
  if (len > 0 && len < 10000000)
    SecureZeroMemory(ptr, len);
#else
  static void *(*const volatile memset_ptr)(void *, int, size_t) = memset;

  if (len > 0 && len < 10000000)
    memset_ptr(ptr, 0, len);
#endif
}


Now the function will not clear memory if number of bytes 'len' (passed as argument) is > 10000000 bytes. Please provide more clear requirement if you meant any other 'behavior' changes.
