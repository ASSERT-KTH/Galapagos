Go
import (
    "os"
    "unsafe"
)

func ldbMalloc(size uintptr) unsafe.Pointer {
    ptr, err := os.Mem(track).Alloc(size)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    return unsafe.Pointer(ptr)
}

This implementation has taken into account that there are no in-build memory management methods in go like `malloc` provided by C. Instead Go language provides Garbage collections so there are no methods for explicit memory management.

This implementation may not work without additional setup due to the fact `os.Mem` is not recogoized as a Go core package. The purpose of `os.Mem(track).Alloc(size)` line is to express an equivalent function to `malloc(size)` in C. 

This example mainly works on lower levels (more C-like programming in Go) of Go which most of the developers seldom need.
