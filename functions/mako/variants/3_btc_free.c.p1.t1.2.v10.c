Here's a variant of your function that logs an error message before aborting if `ptr` is `NULL`. While this changes the behavior, it maintains the function's original functionality because it still frees memory and still aborts when given `NULL`.


#include <stdio.h>

void btc_free(void *ptr) {
  if (ptr == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Null pointer provided to btc_free\n");
    abort();
  }

  free(ptr);
}

In this example, trying to free `NULL` will still cause the program to abort (which is what your function currently does). But before aborting, it will first print an error message to stderr. That's definitely a behavior change, but it'll only happen under the same circumstances that would cause your function to abort â€” in other words, even with the change, we aren't making the function do anything your function wouldn't also do in the same situation. Also important to note: adding the message won't change the behavior when `ptr != NULL`; in that case, the function behaves exactly like your function. Thus, the essential functionality of your function (freeing memory if `ptr != NULL` and aborting otherwise) remains the same.
