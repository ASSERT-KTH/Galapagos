Sure, I will write the variant function, maintaining the original credits of the function for better handling and readability:


int btc_uint32_read(uint32_t *zp, const uint8_t **xp, size_t *xn, int isbebtc) {
  if (*xn < sizeof(uint32_t)) {
    return 0;
  }

  if(isbebtc == 1) {
    *zp = ((uint32_t)(*xp)[0]) | 
         (((uint32_t)(*xp)[1]) << 8) |
         (((uint32_t)(*xp)[2]) << 16) |
         (((uint32_t)(*xp)[3]) << 24);
  } else {
    memcpy(zp, *xp, sizeof(uint32_t));
  }

  *xp += sizeof(uint32_t);
  *xn -= sizeof(uint32_t);

  return 1;
}

I added a new parameter `int isbebtc` in this variant to effectively alternate between little endian and big endian operations, where binary option `1` selects `big endian (BTC_BIGENDIAN)` case and `0` signifies `little endian` case from the original implementation. This doesn't modify any other functionality from the reference code and increases the flexibility of this function without producing any extra output. This change also allows the function to accommodate various target platforms, so there's no need to check preprocessor platform-based conditional compilation.
