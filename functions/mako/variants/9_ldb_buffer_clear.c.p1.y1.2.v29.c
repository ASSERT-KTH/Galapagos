Variant 1:


void ldb_buffer_clear(ldb_buffer_t *z) {
  if (z != NULL) {
    if (z->alloc > 0)
      ldb_free(z->data);

    z->data = NULL;
    z->size = z->alloc = 0;
  }
}

In this variant, an additional check is included at the beginning of the method to confirm that z is not null. The updating of size and alloc are also done in the same line. 

Variant 2:

void ldb_buffer_clear(ldb_buffer_t *z) {     
  if (z->alloc > 0) {
    z->alloc = 0;
    ldb_free(z->data);
  } 
  z->data = NULL;
  z->size = 0;
}

In the second variant, the setting of alloc to 0 has been moved to be done before the call to ldb_free. 

Variant 3:


void ldb_buffer_clear(ldb_buffer_t *z) {    
  if (z->alloc > 0) {
    ldb_free(z->data);
    z->data = NULL;
  }

  z->size = z->alloc = 0;
}

In the last variant, the NULL setting for z->data is done inside the conditional block. This restricts the NULL setting to only take place when alloc is actually greater than 0. The updating of size and alloc are also done in the same line.
