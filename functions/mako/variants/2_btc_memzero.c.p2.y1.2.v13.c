Consider the following C code transformation. The following code tries to guarantee that the memory is actually zeroed, thereby trying to improve the security of the function against specific hardware or operating specific optimizations.


void btc_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
#if defined(BTC_HAVE_ASM)
    if (len != 0) {
        unsigned char *p = ptr;
        while (len--) {
            __asm__ __volatile__ ("" ::: "memory");
            *p++ = 0;
        }
    }
#elif defined(_WIN32) && defined(SecureZeroMemory)
    if (len != 0)
        for(i = 0; i < len; i++)
            ((volatile char *)ptr)[i] = 0;
#else
    volatile unsigned char * volatile ptr_volatile = ptr;
    if (len != 0)
        while (len--)
            *ptr_volatile++ = 0;
#endif
}


This transformation rewrote write cycles to use a buffer instead of the `memset` function, and marked the pointer as `volatile` to disable further compiler optimizations. On architectures supporting inline assembly, it introduces an empty operation between individual byte writes to prevent operation chaining or merging. If SecureZeroMemory is present, each byte is written individually to hit the Core System Libraries code as rarely as possible. On remaining systems, a `volatile` marked word-sized write is used where possible, followed by a loop of individual byte writes for unmatched tail bytes.
