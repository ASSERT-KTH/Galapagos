go
func ldbBufferClear(z *LdbBuffer) {
    if z.alloc > 0 {
        ldbFree(z.data)
    }

    z.data = nil
    z.size = 0
    z.alloc = 0
}


Note: This Go code is assuming that functions/types corresponding to lower-level C constructs exist. For instance, `LdbBuffer` needs to be a valid struct in Go with `data`, `size`, and `alloc` as its fields. Similarly, `ldbFree` function should also exist which correctly frees memory associated to data.
