Please make sure to import the `encoding/binary` package because above function is using `binary.BigEndian`. The `binary.BigEndian` is a bool type constant to check if machine's byte order is in big endian. The actual Go code bases prefer to use 'binary.LittleEndian' to check if it is in little endian.

The function btcUint32Read attempts to perform an operation in the same way as the given C function. Assumption have beend made for mapping the original C types to Go types:
- `uint32_t` matches to Golang's `uint32`.
- `uint8_t` (bytes) are handled as a `slice` in Go.
- `size_t` has been defined as `int` in this given function in Go. Expectation is that, the size of data will never go beyond the limit of an int in this case. This might require validation depending on the actual expected input parameters. The availability of such robust and flexible data types in Go makes it easier to work the same as the behavior of the given C code. Another that should important to cheque is to thoroughly check the function against edge cases to understand if there is any misinterpretation or assumption that could break the code. Only extensive testing will reveal the same.
