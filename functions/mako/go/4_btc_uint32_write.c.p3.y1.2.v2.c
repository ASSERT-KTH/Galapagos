    return zp
}

Note: Perhaps one minor change is, Transform the `uint8_t *zp` argument to a `byte slice []byte` as Go does not have pointer arithmetic. Here the `zp []byte` that provides the same type safety guarantee of only permitting arrays/slices of bytes. However, this demands upstream caller to pass data in Go's slice type rather than a singular pointer.

In the Go presentation, we use the BigEndian utility in the binary package from the standard library. A crucial variance from the initial C function is that Go does not require one identity addition variant manually for structures in major byte order or minor byte order due to inherent cross-architectural properties. In Go, data models will automatically encode and decode structures considering about host endianness. We assumed big endianness for this problem.
