In the Go programming language, you cannot create a semantically exact version because Go does not support the sort of direct memory manipulation and type casting featured in this C code, we must create a logically similar concept.

Please note that we used "jsonIntT" and "jsonIntegerValue" as some alias for Go Map correlation to json_value and json_int_t as C struct. 

The following Block looks similar to an object constructors as seen in object orientated programst that initialize objects and handle memory itself;

go
type jsonValue struct {
   isBuilderValue bool
   t              string
   u              jsonIntT
}

type jsonIntT int64

func jsonIntegerNew(integer jsonIntT) *jsonValue {
   value := &jsonValue{
      isBuilderValue: true,
      t:              "json_integer",
      u:              integer,
   }
   return value
}
 

This solution constructs related go structs type `jsonIntT` for json_int_t and `jsonValue` for json_value and also this similar to json_integer in the form/t : "json_integer". this initialization process returns the address (`*jsonValue`) compares to the similar `{*value}`- from exact C Code. The Go runtime will handle the memory management, so you don't have to manually allocate and deallocate memory like with calloc in C Code.
