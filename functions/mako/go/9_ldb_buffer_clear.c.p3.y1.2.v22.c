In the Go language, there is no feature like 'free' in C because Go uses garbage collector. Therefore, just setting a pointer to 'nil' is enough to clean it up for the garbage collector. Moreover, the original code seems to be based on particular C library or system and thus the translation might have lost inexact concepts and some methods might not work exactly the same as in the original code. But it attempts to replicate the structure and the behavior of the original C code as fully as possible.
