This function writes the 32-bit integer value `x` to the byte slice pointed by `zp`. The writes are made respecting the endianness of the host machineor, which is checked using the condition `binary.BigEndian`.
  
   - If the machine is Big-endian, `x` is disassembled into 4 bytes and each one is written individually to `zp`.
    
   - If the machine is Little-endian, the integer `x` copied directly into memory. The address of `zp` is incremented by 4 to point to the location after the written data.
    
The start address of the written data (`zp`) is returned as a pointer using `unsafe pointer conversion`, The `unsafe` package is neccessary because Go is more strict in type conversions- specifically in pointer-to-pointer and integer-to-pointer conversions.
      
    The returned poinet location is intended to assist continuous writes in main memory, notably for writing arrays of `uint32` using this function.
