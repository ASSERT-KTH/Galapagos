Assuming the `ldb_buffer_t` structure has a similar counter part in Go:

go
type LdbBuffer struct {
	Data  []byte
	Size  int
	Alloc int
}

func (buff *LdbBuffer) LdbBufferClear() {
	if buff.Alloc > 0 {
		buff.Data = nil
	}

	buff.Size = 0
	buff.Alloc = 0
}


In Go, the need to explicitly call a function to free memory isn't necessary. As long as there are no more references to the specific space in memory (like when re-assigning `nil`), Go's garbage collector will free up the memory automatically.

This is assuming the `alloc` field represents the amount of memory currently allocated. The Go's slice (which is the equivalent of C's arrays) will automatically handle the memory allocation.
