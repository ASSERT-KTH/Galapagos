Go does not allow expressing the exact same function as C does, mainly because Go doesn't have union-like structures, you can't use void pointers like C does, nor does Go programming language support allocation using a specific amount of bytes (as related to the calloc() function in the C code.). However, we can create the equivalent function without maintaining function signature, because function signature cannot be same since Go doesn't have equivalent data types like void pointers and unions as in C.

Also it's not clear what type `json_builder_value` is, because it seems like it isn't properly included in this C function's context.

Given the situations and the assumptions about types `json_builder_value` and `json_integer` (I will present `json_integer` as type alias to uint64 and `json_builder_value` and `json_value` as struct types. You can change them suitably related to your entire code.:

Assuming:


go
type json_integer = uint64

type u struct {
   integer json_integer
}

type json_value struct {
   is_builder_value uint8
   typeValu         string
   u                u
}

type json_builder_value struct {
   json_value
   is_builder_value uint8
}


we can create semantically equivalent(`Eager evaluation`) code using the function without maintaining the function signature in Go:

go
func json_integer_new(integer json_integer) *json_value {

   value := &json_value{}
   value.is_builder_value = 1
   value.typeValu = "json_integer"
   value.u.integer = integer

   return value
}


This code should take the passed 'integer', create a new instance of the 'json_value'-type struct. It should check if 'value' returned from `calloc-like operation(uniquely initial value)` in Go isn't nil, then sets the 'is_builder_value' of struct typeValu (which is equivalent to `((json_builder_value *) value)->is_builder_value` as typecasting in c) to '1' as in example and it initializes the other parts of the 'u' struct. As a fail-safe it will return `null equivalent` (nil in Go) if new struct couldn't be made.

Again, definitions of 'json_integer_t', 'json_int_t', 'json_builder_value', 'json_integer', '((json_builder_value *) value)->is_builder_value',  'value->u.integer', 'json_value' can influence more precise translation of this code in Go. Also, analysis implies that semantics like actual allocation on heap has been resembled but not similar entirely as compared to semantics like allocation on heap\stack of C\Python. Consider more suitable usage requirements and modify accordingly.
