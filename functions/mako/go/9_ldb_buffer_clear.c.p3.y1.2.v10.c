func ldbBufferClear(z *ldbBufferT) {
	if z.alloc > 0 {
		free(z.data)
	}

	z.data = nil
	z.size = 0
	z.alloc = 0
} 

Note: There isn't a direct equivalent of `free()` function in Go, because Go handles memory management differently to C, with a built-in garbage collector. This allows you to dynamically assign and free memory without specifically instructing when to free up memory. Once `z.data` pointer or reference is set to `nil`, Go's garbage collector will automatically clear that memory.
