You are, however, mistaken in your original request. Go does not clearly supports explicit deallocation(GO itself handles garbage collections) and it does not allow you to abort the program like the `abort()` function in C per your request.

Although I will adjust accordingly based on what is available in Go if you just want to force stop your program when the interface value passed to the function is null.

go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func btc_free(ptr *interface{}) {
    if ptr == nil {
        fmt.Println("Aborting due to null pointer...") // optional logging message
        os.Exit(1) // Aborting the program
    }
    // Implicit garbage collection happens in place of explicit memory deallocation
}


But this is not recommended as Go itself handles garbage collection and you should not ideally stop a Go program like this. Instead, implement error handling accordingly.
