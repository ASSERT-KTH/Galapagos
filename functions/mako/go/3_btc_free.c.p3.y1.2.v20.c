Go
import (
  "os"
  "unsafe"
)

func btc_free(ptr unsafe.Pointer) {
  if ptr == nil {
    os.Exit(1)
  }

  // Go does not allow direct free operations through a pointer.
  // Garbage collection will resolve this automatically in Go.
}

It should be noted that Go, unlike C language, is equipped with garbage collector which handles the memory automatically. Therefore, any direct free operations through a pointer is not allowed otherwise.
