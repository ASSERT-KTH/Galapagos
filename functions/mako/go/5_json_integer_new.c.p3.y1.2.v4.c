Given that Go has smarter memory management, there is no need for explicit deallocation of memory like C. Hence `calloc` is unavailable in Go but, we use `new()` or just declare a variable of a type to automatically get a zero-valued assigned memory space.

Also, In Go, variant types (i.e. a value that can have one of several types) are implemented using interfaces.

However, Go does not support generics or union-like types in the manner in C, making it a bit challenging to more perfectly map over the provided C data structures.

Below is an assumption of how the value of the integer, and types are stored in struct using Go.
Due to Goâ€™s strict typing, the method signature not remains with caveat. 

Assuming the interface `Json_Value` and struct `json_builder_value`, and a `json_int_t`:

 go
type json_int_t int
type json_integer int

type Json_Value struct {
	is_builder_value bool
	typ json_integer
	integer json_int_t
}


type json_builder_value struct{
        Json_Value
}

func Json_Integer_New(integer json_int_t) *json_builder_value {
	val := new(json_builder_value)
	val.is_builder_value = true
	val.typ = json_integer(1)
	val.integer = integer

	return val
}
 

Consider these a quite important simplification due to compatible Go hierarchy in types and signature with strict Compilation support when compared to C (dynamic), So makes improper for direct roll over/conversion when stepping from C (Variant and pointer support language) and Go(static and strong typing language). More redesign depending upon project complexity has to be padded when using GO.
