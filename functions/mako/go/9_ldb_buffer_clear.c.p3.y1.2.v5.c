In Go programming language, we can't free memory explicitly as Go uses garbage collection to manage memory usage and we can't use pointers as directly as we used to in C. Here is the code that semantically does equivalent work:

go
func ldbBufferClear(z *ldbBufferType) {
	if z.alloc > 0 {
		z.data = nil
	}

	z.size = 0
	z.alloc = 0
}

Assuming that `ldbBufferType` is your equivalent Go's struct representation of `ldb_buffer_t` type in C. As explained before, unlike C, we do not have control to manually free up the memory used by a slice(`z.data` here) in Go. Letting it point to `nil` makes it a candidate for garbage collection provided there are no other references left. This should work perfectly in theory, given that the garbage collection should be able to deallocate the memory.
