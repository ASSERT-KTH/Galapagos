Well, Go has built-in garbage collection. Here’s an explanation for how it handles memory:

In Go language there is no need to manually liberate the memory occupied by variables and objects. Go has a garbage collector that's responsible for periodically clearing up unused memory space that once allocated to variables that are no longer available i.j. gone out of scope or by any other means are no longer available to the program.

This means there is no direct equivalent of the C’s free() function in Golang.

However, if you still need a function without any functionality, here it is:

go
import "os"

func btc_free(ptr *interface{}) {
	if ptr == nil {
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	// nothing - this is managed by Go automatically
}


This function just checks if the pointer is `nil` and, if so, exits, because trying to free memory manually in Go is an error. That's about as close to your C function as you can get. However, in normal Go code, you wouldn't even write this function, because memory management is usually done automatically.
