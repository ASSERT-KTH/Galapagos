It's tricky to directly translate your C code into Go because C and Go fundamentally handle memory, types, and errors in different ways. C directly manipulates memory and explicit null checks, but Go works at a higher level of abstraction, returns error values for exception handling, and has garbage collection so doesn't explicitly need memory allocation and deallocation. 

But, If I infer from the current function provided:

1. You're allocating memory for a "json_value" type and checking for allocation errors.
2. You are converting the "value" pointer to a type that has "is_builder_value" flag, and setting that flag to 1.
3. Then you're setting "type" to json_integer (I'm guessing it's a pre-defined enum/constant in your context), and "integer" as the passed value. 

An equivalent Go method could be defined on "builderValue" (adapted type) and sets various properties assuming that "isBuilderValue" uint flag in 'type':

type jsonBuilderValue struct {
   IsBuilderValue uint
   Type           jsonType
   Integer        int64
}

type jsonType int

const (
   jsonInteger jsonType = iota
)

type jsonValue struct {
   jsonBuilderValue
}

func newJSONInteger(integer int64) *jsonValue {
   return &jsonValue{
      jsonBuilderValue: jsonBuilderValue{
         IsBuilderValue: 1,
         Type:           jsonInteger,
         Integer:        integer,
      },
   }
}

This example assumes that "json_int_t" translates to the int64 type in Go, "json_builder_value" translates to "jsonBuilderValue" and that "json_integer" as an instance of an enumeration "jsonType". Adjust these types as necessary to suit the actual context of the C code you've encountered. This is not a perfect translation, since memory management, error handling, and variable typing works very differently in C and Go.
