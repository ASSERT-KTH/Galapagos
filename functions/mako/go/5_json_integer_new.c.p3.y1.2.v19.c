Unfortunately, the exact function signature and behavior cannot be maintained in Go due to the language's different paradigm. The below code does a similar operation using Go's built-in packages. 

Go does not support uninitialized memory allocation, guarantees system memory safety (returning `nil` for allocation failure), and also does not have a dynamic type field for exported variables, and treats all numbers as integers or custom type conversions which are known at runtime.

Here is a simple return of wrapped integer value to a custom structure.

go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
)

type jsonValue struct {
	Type int `json:"type"`
	u    jsonRawValue
}

type jsonRawValue struct {
	Num int `json:"num"`
}

func JsonIntegerNew(integer int) *jsonValue {
	return &jsonValue{
		Type: 0, 
		u: jsonRawValue{
			Num: integer,
		},
	}
}


This function return `*jsonValue` containing the "type" (json_integer) as int (as in few json packaging which used to define the type of value - represent json datatype identification) & wrapped the integer within a struct - to provide additional properties related to type (used for direct reference without iterations for even complex structure + error handling capabilities). Note that struct values are automatically initialized to their zero values in Go.
