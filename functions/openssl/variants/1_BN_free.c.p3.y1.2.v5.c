It's important to note that the `cgo` package would be necessary to work with OpenSSL in Go because OpenSSL and Go handle memory management very differently. As per your instruction to keep exact function signature, it is not feasible in Go because Go doesn't support pointer comparison like the way in C.

Here is a simple version anyway, bulit upon assuming some appropriate translation of the C-based OpenSSL package to Go (Please, refer to how actual translation should be implemented according to real scenario):

go
import "openssl"

func BnFree(a *openssl.BigNum) {
    if a == nil {
        return
    }
    if !a.GetFlags(openssl.BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA) {
        a.FreeD(0)
    }
    if a.Flags & openssl.BN_FLG_MALLOCED != 0 {
        a.OpenSSlFree()
    }
}
