Here's a semantically equivalent version of the above lower (i.e. less scoping checks) level C code in human renderable Golang language, keeping key operations, actions, checks, and bulks preserved:

Go doesn't allow the manipulation of in-memory data structures directly like C. So, as per the limitations here is an equivalent possible transformation into Go:

go
type BN_CTX struct {
    errStack int
    tooMany  bool
    pool     *BN_POOL // Assuming defined elsewhere
    flags    int
    used     ushort
}

type BIGNUM struct {
    flags int
}

const ERR_LIB_BN = 1                          // assuming definition
const BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES = 1  // assuming definition
const BN_FLG_CONSTTIME = 1                    // assuming definition

func BN_CTX_get(ctx *BN_CTX) *BIGNUM {
    // assuming the definition of the function BN_POOL_get(p *BN_POOL, f int) *BIGNUM
    var ret *BIGNUM
    // note: assuming errStack type is int where 0 means no error and not a pointer mimicking C-null
    if ctx.errStack != 0 || ctx.tooMany {
        return nil
    }

    if ret = BN_POOL_get(ctx.pool, ctx.flags); ret == nil {
        ctx.tooMany = true
        // ERR_raise has been replace in Go by errorf calls
        errorf("BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES")
        return nil
    }

    // 'BN_zero' operation replacement
    *ret = BIGNUM{}

    // clear BN_FLG_CONSTTIME if leaked from previous frames causes a well needed muting for race-condition-possible high level operations
    ret.flags &= ^BN_FLG_CONSTTIME

    ctx.used++
    return ret
}


Please note in mind that the ability to manipulate memory & state data (flags etc.) depends on the underlying agreement there (which relays back/reference towards the concept of the place, struct), involves the order of translation, targets, and operational settings/transitivity and the such (that we can't possibly target correctly without additional specifications), ie detailed info (how and occurrence-frequency and entropy-data related to concurrency) on struct position dependent manipulation etc.
