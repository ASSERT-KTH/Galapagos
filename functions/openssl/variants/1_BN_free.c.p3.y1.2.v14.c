The given C code cannot be directly translated into Go because Go does not have direct equivalent functionality and provides automatic garbage collection. There would be no analog to the `BN_free(BIGNUM *a)` function in C. Also, `BIGNUM *a` and associated methods like `OPENSSL_free(a);` or `BN_get_flags(a, BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA)` aren't available in Go. There also aren't any built-in equivalents because Go does not provide the to programmer the same kind of direct control over memory management as C does; in Go, memory freeing typically shorter-lived dynamically allocated memory is handled by the Go runtime and its garbage collector.

The equivalent function structure would ideally look like:

go
func BNFree(a *big.Int) {
    // dereference **a* to null_big. This concept does not exist in GO.
}
var null_big big.Int

a := big.NewInt(10)
BNFree(&a)

but what this function effectively is trying to do is dereference **a* to null_big. This concept does not exist in Go as Go will hold reference until garbage collector cleans non-referenced items. Therefore passing to *a would actually wouldn't mutate the main variable a. However, the code block shows how in Go **person* variables are passed.

In general, Go was designed to provide automatic memory management, and as a result, many of the issues that functions like `BN_free(BIGNUM *a)` were designed to deal with in C don't apply.
