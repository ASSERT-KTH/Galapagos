Since Go language does not support pointer comparison to null and does not have C style macros, it is impossible to create a one to one semantically equivalent version of the C function provided. However, taking into account Go built-in safety and garbage collection mechanisms, a rough equivalent of this mentioned C function in Go could be as follows:

golang
import "sync"

type EVP_PKEY struct {
	References  int
	Lock        *sync.Mutex
	ExData      []byte
	Attributes  [][]byte
	freeContent func(*EVP_PKEY)
}

func (e *EVP_PKEY) Free() {
	if e == nil {
		return
	}

	e.Lock.Lock()
	e.References--
	refNum := e.References
	e.Lock.Unlock()

	if refNum > 0 {
		return
	}

	if e.freeContent != nil {
		e.freeContent(e)
	}

	e.ExData = nil
	e.Attributes = nil
	e.Lock = nil
}

The type `EVP_PKEY` defines a method `Free()` that provides roughly equivalent functionality as in original.

The above code makes various assumptions, as follows:

1. The `CRYPTO_DOWN_REF`, `REF_PRINT_COUNT` and `REF_ASSERT_ISNT` macros in C function are roughly taken as decrementing the reference count and treating errors correctly. Here, the reference count is decremented and, if it is greater than zero still, the function returns.

2. `evp_pkey_free_it(x)` calls some EVP_PKEY-specific content freeing function.

3. Memory management and garbage-collection for the struct's content in the end is already cared for in Go.

4. It's presumed here that, definitions for `CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_EVP_PKEY`, `FIPS_MODULE`, functions `CRYPTO_free_ex_data`, `CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free`, `sk_X509_ATTRIBUTE_pop_free`, `X509_ATTRIBUTE_free`, `OPENSSL_free` etc. and the structs they use, is present in original C code.

But since this them is unaware of the larger context and semantic interpretation of the involve types and functions used in your C function, direct mapping between C and Go like this introduces a lot of uncertainties and this could well be wrong or misinterpreted so one should make certain adjustments as per specific requirements.
