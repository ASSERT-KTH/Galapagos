The equivalent go language function for the above C code is:

Before writing the code just a mention over here. Go doesn't have a direct equivalent to C's *BIGNUM* type as used in your code. I am going to use the *big.Int* type from the *math/big* package, but please be aware it's not directly equivalent.

go
import (
   "math/big"
)

func BN_free(a *big.Int) {
    if a == nil {
        return
    }
    
    flag := BN_get_flags(a, BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA)
    if !flag {
        bn_free_d(a, 0)
    }
    
    flag = a.Bit(BN_FLG_MALLOCED)
    if flag == 1 {
       OPENSSL_free(a)
   }
}

// please define these depended auxiliary functions like BN_get_flags, bn_free_d, OPENSSL_free

Please be noted that, In Go, we frequently design/encapsulation a mechanism for garbage collection. Those are ensuring proper resource allocation, avoiding memory leaks because Go has garbage collection. So probably do not need code equivalent to C `free` or `OPENSSL_free`.
