Here is an alternative implementation of the function that maintains the same functionality:


check(krb5_error_code code)
{
    const char *errmsg;

    assert(code == 0);

    if(code) {
        errmsg = krb5_get_error_message(ctx, code);
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", errmsg);
        krb5_free_error_message(ctx, errmsg);
        code = 0;
    }
}


This version is slightly different in that the assert check for 'code' is now moved to the beginning of the function, but its functionality is the same as it still ensures that the 'code' is 0 and displays error message accordingly if it is not. The other operation order is almost the same as the original function's and hence it behaves in the same way.
