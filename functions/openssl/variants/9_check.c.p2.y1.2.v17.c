The following is a program transformation that makes use of exception handling for enhancing the functionality and clarity of the initial code.

This code assumes that 'krb5_get_error_message' and 'krb5_free_error_message' are defined and they might throw some exceptions upon execution, which hypothetically happens in effective handling and efficient code.

In this transformation, I have added the try catch block for potential error handling and exception throwing purpose without touching the initial main functionality of the function. I have handled one particular error case separately; rest of hypothetical issues or potential errors would expect to be handled in a generalized catch block in else section. 

check(krb5_error_code code)
{
    const char *errmsg;

    try {
        if (code != 0) {
            errmsg = krb5_get_error_message(ctx, code);
            if (errno != 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", "Unable to fetch the error message");
                exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
            }
            fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", errmsg);
            krb5_free_error_message(ctx, errmsg);
        }
        assert(code == 0); 
    } catch (...) { 
        /* exceptions would be handled here in generalized way if they occur any to ensure smooth execution of the code */
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", "Encountered Unhandled Exception");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }    
}
