Go has a garbage collector which automatically handles freeing up memory, unlike in C where you must manually free memory that you've allocated. As such, certain parts of the C function do not translate directly into go. The converted code might something like as follows.

go
func BNFree(a *big.Int) {
	if a == nil {
		return
	}
	if !BNGetFlags(a, bnFlgStaticData) {
		BNFreeD(a, 0)
	}
	if a.flags&BNFlgMalloced != 0 {
		// Memory is automatically deallocated by the garbage collector in Go
	}
}


However, please note that libraries regarding OpenSSL functionality and their flags such as 'BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA', 'bn_free_d(a, 0)', or 'BN_FLG_MALLOCED' are not specified here and do not have direct counterparts in standard Go. Therefore, direct similarity cannot be achieved.

Moreover, 'big.Int' in 'math/big' package of Go is used as the replacement for the `BIGNUM` type. As a built-in package in Go, it comes with a high-precision arithmetic functionality, with possible suitability.
