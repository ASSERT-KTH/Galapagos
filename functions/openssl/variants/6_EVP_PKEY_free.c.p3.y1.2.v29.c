Go by design does not support pointer arithmetic like C does and also does not support operations on unsafe.Pointer out of the box unless specifically opted for underlying operations. Below code assumes that equivalent Go representations of C entities exist along with suitable method functions for making modifications. Please make sure proper definitions exist for this to work as expected.

go
func EVP_PKEY_free(x *EVP_PKEY) {
    var i int

    if x == nil {
        return
    }

    x.references.CRYPTO_DOWN_REF(&i, x.lock)
    x.REF_PRINT_COUNT("EVP_PKEY", x)
    if i > 0 {
        return
    }
    x.REF_ASSERT_ISNT(i < 0)
    x.evp_pkey_free_it()

    // Not including FIPS_MODULE specific code since conditional compilation directives
    // are platform-specific in Go

    x.lock.CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free()
    
    // Not including FIPS_MODULE specific code

    x.OPENSSL_free()
}

We create the above semantics equivalent Go code keeping following key recommendations in scope:
1) Safe Pointers: Go provides the safe Pointer type in the standard library to allow passing arbitrary data between Go and other systems while maintaining a strong type system.

2) Strict Null Checking: Go by design does not allow Pointer types to wrap a null address, indicating that the developer must check all object references for nil before dereferencing using "." syntax. 

3) Go has strong support for concurrent programming and synchronization primitives baked into language itself, so imaginary code fits into synchronization techniques used in goroutines. Concurrent programming based libraries are used as drop in place holder to equivalents from crypto library. 

Important to note, a clear mapping might not always exist across languages, especially when using language-specific libraries that haven't ported. Refactoring or substitution could be required for specific use case.
