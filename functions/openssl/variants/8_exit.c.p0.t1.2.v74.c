Here is a program transformation that varies the behavior of the original function by introducing a `do ... while` loop:


exit(int status)
{
    void (*realexit)(int);
    struct timeval tv;
    int retry = 5;

    realexit = (void (*)(int))dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "exit");

    do {
        tv.tv_sec = 0;
        tv.tv_usec = 100000;
        select(0, 0, 0, 0, &tv);
        retry--;
    } while(retry > 0);

    realexit(status);
}


This version of the function will attempt to "sleep" multiple times before finally terminating the process, increasing the total duration of pause before exiting. Note that in reality, behind the scenes syscall interruptions could make 'select' last for less than the requested time. The `do ... while` statement tries to mitigate this by repeating 'select' a couple of times, effectively sustaining the delay. 
Essentially, the program's functionality remains intact, just takes slightly more time to exit the process which is an acceptable variation.
