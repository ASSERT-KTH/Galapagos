Unfortunately, we cannot implement an exact replica of the given C function in Go due to language differences and lack of equivalent libraries. It's possible to simulate functionality of C functions using built-in Go primitives, but applying logic exactly stemming from the original code might not entirely work.

Here's the attempt for a conversion for you to consider. Be aware changes in languages libraries can result in dramatical differences, such as the memory management functions.

Here is a simple equivalence in Go but it doesn't take into account crypto specific operations ranging from CRYPTO_DOWN_REF to CRYPTO_free_ex_data & sk_X509_ATTRIBUTE_pop_free etc.

go
type EVP_PKEY struct { 
    references int
    lock sync.Mutex
    ex_data string
    attributes []*X509Attribute
}

func EVP_PKEY_free(x *EVP_PKEY) { 
    if x == nil {
        return 
    }

    x.lock.Lock()
    defer x.lock.Unlock()

    // Decrease reference count
    x.references--
    fmt.Printf("EVP_PKEY: %+v\n", x)

    if x.references > 0 {
        return
    }
   
    if x.references < 0 {
        panic("Reference count less than 0")
    }
  
    // Dummy function
    evp_pkey_free_it(x)

    /*
        Crypto specific functions
        -----

        These functions are commonly found within the some properly implemented crypto libraries e.g "crypto"
        Unfortunately, Go natively doesn't support these operations and mapping directly or necessary crypto library and init/import in GO
     
        Crypto_free_ex_data_here -> x.ex_data
        Clean x.attributes
    */

    // Emulating memory deallocation below
    x = nil
}
 

NOTE: Go has a garbage collector GC which cannot be directly controlled or directly this doesn't work like C; Go itself controls GC. Thus, Go generally doesn't require 'free' Equivalent. For memory allocation/de-allocation Golang always handled by run time routines.
