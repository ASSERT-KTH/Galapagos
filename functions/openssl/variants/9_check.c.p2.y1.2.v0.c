Here's a function which maintains the responsiveness of the initial function but slightly varies its behavior. In this variant, the assertion has been replaced with conditional error exit for better error handling. Rather than just immediately forcing a program termination via "assert", it provides a conditional check that provides debugging or error handling chance in case of code input not zero.


#include <stdlib.h> // For exit() function

void check(krb5_error_code code)
{
    const char *errmsg;

    if (code != 0) {
        errmsg = krb5_get_error_message(ctx, code);
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", errmsg);
        krb5_free_error_message(ctx, errmsg);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE); // Exit program with an error code
    }
}


This alternative transformation allows for the same functionality but in this case, handling of scenario when the error code isn't equal to 0 is shifted from "assertion of zero" to "expecting an explicit zero".   This alternative might be beneficial because it provides a safer exit procedure and makes clear the expectations from error code.
 
Please keep in mind that, these transformations can have implications on how your program operates overall. They display slight functional changes even though they align with initial assertion of expecting a zero-error code.
