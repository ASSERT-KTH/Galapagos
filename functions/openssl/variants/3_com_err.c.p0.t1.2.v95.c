In the given function, the va_list 'ap' is just used once. Afterwards the function 'com_err_va' is called. A modification of this function could be to make multiple checks and call different functions optionally. Another modification in terms in handling the variable argument is shown: 


void KRB5_CALLCONV_C com_err(const char *whoami, 
                              errcode_t code, 
                              const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list ap;

    va_start(ap, fmt);
    
    if(code < 0){
        com_err_negative_code(whoami, code, fmt, ap);
    } else if (fmt != NULL) {
        com_err_non_null_fmt(whoami, code, fmt, ap);
    } else {
        com_err_va(whoami, code, fmt, ap);
    }

    va_end(ap);
}


On this function, an additional 'if' check is added to handle errors in different ways according to the 'code' value. For negative codes 'com_err_negative_code' is called, for non-null formatted strings 'com_err_non_null_fmt' function is introduced and then 'com_err_va' is a catch-all for all other situations. Please note that 'com_err_negative_code', 'com_err_non_null_fmt' and 'com_err_va' are just placeholders and the executability will depend on their appropriate implementations. The function maintains the original 'com_err' signature. The error handling with variable arguments is preserved. The va_list 'ap' still undergoes 'va_start' and 'va_end' and no auxiliary functions were created.
