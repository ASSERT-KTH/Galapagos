As Go does not support classes or functions overloads like C++, the semantically equivalent version of the code cannot maintain the original function's signature. LargeInteger and BigNumber operations that use OpenSSL's BN functionality can't be translated into Go easily because Go's standard library does not provide low-level access to the system's underlying bignum operations and uses other math libraries instead. The equivalent functionality would require customized Go implementation or wrapping Go-around low-level libraries. Construction of such functionality can be quite challenging without auxiliary function with needed complexity consideration. 

A direct one to one translation could mean porting/significantly rewriting entire OpenSSL's BN functionality into Go, which is an entirely different problem, beyond the possibility of similar function development. However, big.Int structure in Go math/big package supports most of abstract mathematical operations for arbitrary-precision arithmetic (bignums). There aren't any flag operations ('BN_FLG_CONSTTIME') concept in Go directly so that couldn't be possible either. Sorry but there needs to be quite a few comprehensions conceded to make this a practical operation.

Sample initiating code will be (but merely scraping what the given function could do):

go
import (
    "errors"
    "math/big"
)

type BnCtx struct {
    errStack        erroress
    flag            bool
}

ErrGetError := errors.New("Operation Miscoded")

func BnCtxGet(ctx *BnCtx) (*big.Int, error) {
    if len(ctx.ctx.errStack) > 0 || ctx.ctx.flag {
        return nil, ErrGetError
    }
    
    ret := big.NewInt(0)
    
    ctx.ctx.flag = true

    return ret, nil
}
