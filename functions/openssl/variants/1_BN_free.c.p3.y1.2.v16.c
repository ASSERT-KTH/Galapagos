In Go, memory management is largely handled automatically, so directly translating this C function to Go isn't quite viable. However, assuming that BIGNUM is a type used to deal with big natural (non-negative) numbers and the flags have something to do with the handling & storage of that number, we would have something similar to `big.Int` type from Go's math/big package.

Here's the note: in Go, there may be no equivalent for "BN_get_flags", "BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA", "BN_FLG_MALLOCED" as a part of "math/big" package or any standard library at all because about memory management in Go relies on Garbage Collection.

However, the code below preserves the function's structure:

go
// assuming BIGNUM implementation
type BIGNUM struct {}

func BN_free(a *BIGNUM) {
    if a == nil {
        return
    }
    // .. no static data or malloc flags in standard Go
}
  
As said before, the nature of the C code's memory management checks (observing flags and possibly freeing pointers) do not have a semantic equivalent in Go. This is because Go's "garbage collector" automatically manages memory, which leaves no manual mechanism necessary. Regardless, the function signature is preserved above: a function called "BN_free", which accepts a pointer to a BIGNUM type and performs actions based on conditions related to that pointer being zero or not.
