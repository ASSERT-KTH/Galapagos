Unfortunately, a semantically equivalent implementation in Go is not entirely possible when trying to exactly replicate the function's signature. There are three reasons for this:

1. Go does not directly support the dynamic linking and symbol resolution that the `dlsym()` function in C provides. You can use cgo to call into C libraries when needed, but this route ought to be avoided if possible, to favor idiomatic, "Go-only" solutions. To find an equivalent function for `dlsym()`, it is important to understand its purpose in the code. The `dlsym()` function is trying to hook onto or rather find the symbol named "exit" in a shared library and call that instead. Go typically encourages viewing these things at a higher level involving interfaces and the like, instead of raw symbol lookups seen in this C code.

2. In Go functions are first class citizens, meaning functions cannot be passed its addresses or obtain its addresses, There is no equivalent functionality to assign a "function of int32 argument" to a "function of int" in Go like performed in C, i.e.: `realexit = (void (*)(int))dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "exit");`.

3. Trace and System execution model is different in Go than C. For instance, in this C code four arguments represent the highested file descriptor +1.
   - In loop construct for descriptor sets are checked and checked by select() are integer handles. The equivalent concept does not exist in runtime representation of Go. Instead of using select() on file descriptors, we can manage that concurrency using Select on Channels. It isn't close to the equivalent functionality of the `select` syscall in C.

Although the `os.Exit()` process termination function does exist, circumstances and other system behaviors mean this transformation is not semantically identical to given C implementation.
