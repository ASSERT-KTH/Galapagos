It's important to note that Go doesn't have direct equivalents for krb5 error handling functions and also doesn't support custom error codes. However, we may mimic the behavior using standard Go error handling approach. Also note that in Go, assertions are usually made by explicitly checking the conditions. Here is the requested code:

go
import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"
)

func check(code int) {
    if code != 0 {
        err := fmt.Errorf("Error Code: %d", code)
        _, _ = fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
    }

    if code != 0 {
        log.Fatal("Assertion Error: code is not zero")
    }
}


In this version, we simply check if the error code is not zero. If it is, we create an `error` type variable concatenating "Error Code: " with the code using the `fmt.Errorf()` function, then we print it to the standard error. 

If `code` is not 0, we invoke `log.Fatal` which is equivalent to `Print()` followed by a call to `os.Exit(1)`. In this way we ensure that if `code` is not 0, the program will be forcefully terminated - similar to how `assert(LocalVariable == 0)` behaves in the original C code. However, keep in mind that programming styles and philosophies among different programming languages may not necessarily promote similar constructs or practices.
