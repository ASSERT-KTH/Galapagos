It's not possible to create a direct equivalent for this C code in Go for multiple reasons such as Go doesn't expose C's exit function in its library, Go does not allow puting process to sleep without goroutines, the 'dlsym' function and 'RTLD_NEXT' constant are not a part of the Go standard libraries as 'dlsym' function and 'RTLD_NEXT' constant is part of dlfcn.h - it's a POSIX library for loading and interacting with dynamic libraries at runtime.

However we can recreate temporary function in Go mode to make similar code behaviourally. It won't be identical, for instance calling 'os.Exit' in Go not only terminates the process but also many of the defer statements are not executed if there is a call to 'os.exit'. Hence using channels and goroutines are more efficient for delay purpose in golang as of which below is suggested approach :

Go
package main

import (
    "os"
    "os/signal"
    "time"
    "syscall"
)

/*
 * setup function processes incoming signals and exits when required
 */
func setupExitHandler(exitChan chan int) {
    signalChannel := make(chan os.Signal)
    signal.Notify(signalChannel, os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM, syscall.SIGQUIT)
  
    go func() {
        signalType := <-signalChannel
        switch signalType {
            case os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM, syscall.SIGQUIT:
                exitChan <- 0
        }
    }()
}

/*
 * exit function which behaves similarly as the C exit(int status)
 */
func exit(status int) {
    exitChan := make(chan int)

    // Use a Goroutine as setupExitHandler is blocking
	go setupExitHandler(exitChan)
	
	// wait for 100 microseconds
    time.Sleep(time.Microsecond * 100)
	
	// set signal for other routines that program is existing
    select {
    case code := <-exitChan:
        os.Exit(code)
    default:
        os.Exit(status)
    }
}



Remember: This code does not handle the exact semantics as exit(int status) in C codes. It is a hacky way to give similar behaviour to exit(int status) in Go codes.
