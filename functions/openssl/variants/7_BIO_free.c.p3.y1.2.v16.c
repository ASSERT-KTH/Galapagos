The Go Language does not allow direct pointer manipulation as done in C, hence the operation `BIO_free(NULL)` cannot be done.

go
func BIO_free(a *BIO) int {

    if a == nil {
        return 0
    }

    ret := CRYPTO_DOWN_REF(&a.references, a.lock)
    if ret <= 0 {
        return 0
    }
    
    REF_PRINT_COUNT("BIO", a)
    if ret > 0 {
        return 1
    }
    
    if HAS_CALLBACK(a) {
        ret = int(bio_call_callback(a, "BIO_CB_FREE", nil, 0, 0, 0, 1, nil))
        if ret <= 0 {
            return 0
        }
    }
    
    if a.method != nil && a.method.destroy != nil{
        a.method.destroy(a)
    }
    
    CRYPTO_free_ex_data("CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_BIO", a, &a.exData)
    CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free(a.lock)
    OPENSSL_free(a)

    return 1    
}


In this particular code example, there are instances such as `CRYPTO_DOWN_REF(&a->references, &ret, a->lock)` which cannot be reproduced exactly in Go. 

If "CRYPTO_DOWN_REF", "REF_PRINT_COUNT", "REF_ASSERT_ISNT", "HAS_CALLBACK", "bio_call_callback", "CRYPTO_free_ex_data", "CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free", "OPENSSL_free" functions and the "BIO" structure are part of the OpenSSL project, those would need to be wrapped using cgo or reinplemented in Go in the context of port SSL's specific BIO behavior into Go code. The Go standard library does not support OpenSSL bio methods in their net/http and crypto/tls packages, so the code would you be very different if you coded if from zero on in Go. It would make more sense to just write code that performs equivalent tasks rather than translating it directly.
