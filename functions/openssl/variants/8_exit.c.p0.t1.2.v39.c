Here's an alternate version of the function with some minor changes:


exit(int status)
{
    void (*new_exit)(int);
    struct timeval tv;

    tv.tv_sec = 0;
    tv.tv_usec = 125000; // change from 100000 to extend the delay slightly
    new_exit = (void (*)(int))dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "exit");
    select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, &tv); // Refactoring code, no functional change
    new_exit(status);
}


This new version alters the delay before exiting and renames the function pointer for added semantic clarity. The program will wait slightly longer before calling the exit function. Otherwise, everything remains functionally identical; the delay is still present, and exit() is still what gets called when the function finishes.
