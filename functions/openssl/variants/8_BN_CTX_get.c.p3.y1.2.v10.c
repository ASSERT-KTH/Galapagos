In the Go programming language, we cannot maintain the exact original function signature because Go has a different type system and doesn't natively support pointers in the same way as C and there is no BIGNUM package implemented by Go standard library. However, providing a rough approximation can be represented using big integers from Go's math/big package:

go
import (
    "math/big"
)

func Get(ctx *Context) *big.Int {
    if ctx.errStack || ctx.tooMany {
        return nil
    }
    ret, err := ctx.pool.Get(ctx.flags)
    if err != nil {
        ctx.tooMany = true
        return nil
    }

    ret.SetInt64(0)
    ret &= 0 << big.ConstTime
    ctx.used += 1
    return ret
}


In the Go code,
- BIGNUM is translated into big.Int,
- BN_CTX_get is translated into Get,
- The function CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free lock = ctx->lock is not directly translated because Go uses goroutines for low-level concurrency, which doesn't need mutexes in this context.
- BN_POOL_get is replaced with pool.Get and requires a change in overall pattern being not only to package external routines.
- Go has garbage collection, which means that you don't manually free memory like in C.
- ERR_raise is omitted as Go does not have a similar concept. In Go you usually simply return errors.

Remember Go, like JavaScript or Python, executes in one OS thread by default, synchronously. A Goroutine gives you a lightweight way to multi-thread, but again, it's that the GIL still implies a "stop the world" event. Bignum usage like this seems either old, or designed to perform well on very old, single CPU servers.

Also, note the subtle difference that unlike the original function, which modifies the source Context structure and returns only a pointer to BIGNUM, the Go function returns a full big.Int variable without changing the receiver ctx.
