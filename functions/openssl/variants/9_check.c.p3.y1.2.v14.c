Due to different nature and structure of C and Go languages, especially given that Go has a built-in error handling system and the widely varying way that errors are treated in both languages, it's not directly possible to maintain the exact function signature of the C function in Go version. But we can create semantically equivalent function in Go in terms of error checking and handling.

go
import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func check(code error) {
	if code != nil {
		fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, code)
	} else {
		log.Fatal("Assertion failure: the error code must be zero. But received:", code)
	}
}

This function will perform like as:
- If error code is not ZERO, the error message prints to stderr (the equivalent in Go of the `fprintf` C function using the `stderr` parameter).
- It assumes assertion failure when the `log.Fatal` method is called. The program will be stopped if the assertion pass in the same way assert works in the C program.
