Here's one possible variant:


void KRB5_CALLCONV_C com_err(const char *whoami,
                             errcode_t code,
                             const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list ap;

    va_start(ap, fmt);

    if(code == SUCCESS_CODE)
    {
        // Do not process the error if the 'code' indicates a success
        va_end(ap);

        return;
    }
    
    com_err_va(whoami, code, fmt, ap);
    va_end(ap);
}


In this variant, a simple condition was added to skip processing when the passed error code is equivalent to a certain constant (e.g. `SUCCESS_CODE`). However, this code assumes that there exists a specific value to indicate a 'successful' code. Replace `SUCCESS_CODE` with the real value as needed, because it may differ across different systems and conventions. Keep in mind, that for the 'success' situation there should be no need to call an error handling function. So, it's essential to implement a condition that manages that. 

Note: This transformation relies on information about the specific nature of 'code' that isn't available just from looking at the function signature, so it might be a bit outside the scope of given information. The specific value indicating 'success' really depends on your codebase or generally the relevant system values regarding 'error codes', 'return values' etc.
