It is not directly possible to convert this C code to Go as is, given Go's garbage collector system that manages memory allocation itself. In Go, you don't manually allocate and deallocate memory like in C. Go also doesnâ€™t have a direct equivalent of using pointers to handle data. 

As a result the `EVP_PKEY_free` function from C would not be required in Go where memory is automatically managed.

In theory, you could use cgo, Go's foreign function interface (FFI), to call into C libraries if you need to execute this or similar functions directly., however, it also eliminates the main advantage of Go that includes easier concurrency and garbage collection.

Below is a simplistic concept of how we might express such function:

go
import (
    "C"
)

func EVP_PKEY_free(x *C.EVP_PKEY) {
    if x==nil {
        return
    }
    
    var i int
    
    // Those functions might not exist in GO as they are probably linked to C OpenSSL library and wasn't translated to Go
    C.CRYPTO_DOWN_REF((*C.int)(&x.references), (*C.int)(&i), x.lock)    
    C.REF_PRINT_COUNT("EVP_PKEY", x.ctypes.c_void_p)
    
    if i > 0 {
        return
    }  
    
    C.REF_ASSERT_ISNT(i < 0)    
    C.evp_pkey_free_it(x)   
    // Deallocating unassigned variables or data structures is automatically done by Go's garbage collector 
    
    // Not ok because might cause problems with Go's garbage collector
    //C.openSSL_free(x.ctypes.c_void_p)    
}

The `// those functions might not exist...` bit is a sign of two other problems. 

Please remember, it is strongly discouraged to use C imported functions as in Go programming it would be better to find a library that has similar functionality in pure Go version. If you use OpenSSL library a lot it would be productive and safer to step out of the Go safe language capabilities to use OpenSSL, due to compatibilities and potential memory issues.
