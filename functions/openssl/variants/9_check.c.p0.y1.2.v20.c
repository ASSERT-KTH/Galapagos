Here is a substitute implementation that provides the same functionality, but uses different syntax:


void check(krb5_error_code code)
{
    if(code) {
        const char *message;
        message = krb5_get_error_message(ctx, code);
        fputs(message, stderr);
        putc('\n', stderr);
        krb5_free_error_message(ctx, message);
        assert(!code);
    }
}

Like the previous function, it handles non-zero codes by getting the appropriate error message, writing it to stderr, releasing it, and then asserting that the code is zero. 

Create a substitute implementation of the function, which is different but equivalent:

However, it uses the `fputs` function, which does not require a new line to be specified, and the `putc` function to separately output the new line. These differences allow it to maintain the original functionality in a slightly different manner.
