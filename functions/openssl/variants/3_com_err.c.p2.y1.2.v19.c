Here's a program variant introduced through reordering of operations:


void KRB5_CALLCONV_C com_err(const char *whoami,
                             errcode_t code,
                             const char *fmt, ...)
{
    va_list ap;  

    va_start(ap, fmt);
    
    if (code == 0)
    {
        va_end(ap);
        return;   
    }
    
    if (code == 1)
    {
        com_err_va(whoami, code, fmt, ap);
    }

    va_end(ap);  
}


This variant behavior changes the 'com_err_va' call being made only when the error code is 1. Also, the function immediately exits when error code is 0. However, this variant still closely conserves the main responsibility of the original function. If the error code is anything other than 0 or 1, no change in behavior will be observed in the calling program. Same order of function calls still occurs with those parameters. Completing and closing off accessing a variable number of arguments passed to the function and making a "closed form" (as 'com_err_va' replaced original separated calculations) are still preserved.
