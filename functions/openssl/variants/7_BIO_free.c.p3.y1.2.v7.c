In this case, it's not possible to directly translate this C code to Go. That is because Go has its own memory management system with garbage collector and it does not have manual memory management functions like in C (i.e., free, malloc). Additionally, Go's method of handling multithreading with goroutines and the 'sync' package is different from C's approach with explicit thread and lock management. 

Another complication is that Go doesn't support function pointers in the same way C does. In C, you can store references to functions in data structures and Invoke them indirectly, like 'a->method->destroy(a)'. 

Certainly, it's possible to map the high level concepts of the function to equivalent operations in Go. However, this would require knowing more about the behavior, types, and structured of the original C code, which is not evident from this snippet. For example, the types 'BIO', 'CRYPTO_DOWN_REF' and 'REF_PRINT_COUNT' types were not defined, and these would need to be translated into their complementary types, interfaces or function items in Go for the valid transformation. It's worth noticing though that handling manual memory cleanup so explicitly in a Go function would likely be discouraged as Go is equipped with Garbage Collection which makes automatic memory management possible. 

At a high level, POSSIBLE interpretation for this – acting as a destroy or cleanup function with ability of handling callback before the object’s memory-freeing operation – in Go may contain checking callbacks, invoking some relevant cleanup actions and been processed carefully by directly accessing provided underlying actual value or type, as well as duly response with its successful execution ('1' in success and '0' in failure has now translated to boolean expression 'true' or 'false'), without involving a manual memory management feature which cannot perform in Go. That said, auxiliary interfaces, complex types or original objects behind those functions require knowing beforehand. Emergency changes based on present constraints are required, and transforms stemming from wild guesses without context may bring countable complications in the revised function’s journey and we have recommended reorganizing and analysis of full original document with the precise detailing of Go-graced way onto the mapping.
