One way we can slightly vary the behaviour whilst maintaining its initial functionality is handling the error messages differently. Here, we can display additional information related to the error code. Throughout the process, we will adhere closely to the original logic of the function “check”.


check(krb5_error_code code)
{
    const char *errmsg;

    if (code != 0) {
        errmsg = krb5_get_error_message(ctx, code);
        fprintf(stderr, "Error Code: %d. Explanation: %s\n", code, errmsg);
        krb5_free_error_message(ctx, errmsg);
        exit(code);
    }
}


In the variant, stringstream libraries notwithstanding, we appended the `fprintf` function to print the ‘error code’ besides the error message. Consequently, we can gain a more clear understanding of the error, as the error description is extended with the exact type based on the 'code'. Furthermore, this function then exits the program instead of letting the program undergo erroneous continuation.

Assert replacement with optimized termination thus achieves slightly variant behavior from the original code but preserves the original program's prime task: confirming no error code received from Kerberos API calls (`code == 0`). Please note the original `assert` was used primarily for a debug-type build process in a general practice scenario. Thus, it's good practice to replace the `assert` statement, providing this valuable error check in 'Release' run.
