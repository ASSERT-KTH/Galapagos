Unfortunately, it's not straightforward to convert this C code into Go directly because the Go programming language doesn't have an exact replacement for C-style pointers, address-of operator (&), dereference operator (*), and the process about memory management there isn't Go's garbage collector. Also Go does not support method or function constructions with pointer receivers in the signature or function direct error handling like we could in C. 

Furthermore, there is no direct library one can provide that matches OpenSSL's bignum or BN_CTX struct in Go language. It also does not support bitwise operation on boolean or "flag variables" like in your current C code.

For semantic structure conversion, Go handles error in a very different way by usually returning error in the second return value (if they exist). Here's a subtle reinterpretation of the function:

go
type BNCTX struct {
	errStack   bool
	tooMany    bool
	pool       *BNPool
	flags      uint64
	used       bool
}

type BIGNUM struct {
    flags uint64
    val *big.Int
}

func BNCTXGet(ctx *BNCTX) (*BIGNUM, error) {
    var ret *BIGNUM

    if ctx.errStack || ctx.tooMany {
        return nil, errors.New("errStack is true or attempted to get too many")
    }

    var err error
    ret, err = ctx.pool.BNPOOLGet(ctx.flags)

    if err != nil {
        ctx.tooMany = true
        return nil, errors.New("BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES failure")
    }

    ret.val.SetInt64(0)
    ret.flags &^= BIGNUMFlags
    ctx.used = true
    
    return ret, nil
}


Keep in mind that this new version should have identical functionality as the one above, albeit pivoted syntax and structures around the way Go is designed. 

This Go version does little to no handling and assumes that you have already defined BNPOOLGet in your BNPool type along with your BIGNUMFlags However, it can give you a foothold in how you could get started on this. The key ideas for redesign comes from refashioning how predicate and failure checks were triggered.

Depending upon what the above definitions and state hold for your programming needs, the Go function can look quite different. Make sure to replace my placeholder errors with ones you deem more appropritate for your programming context. Let me know how I may further assist you in developing this function.
