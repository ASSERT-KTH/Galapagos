Here is a restructured version of the EVP_PKEY_free() function where the nested if conditions are flattened for readability and early evaluation. The order of functions' execution and checks on data maintain the original functionality.


void EVP_PKEY_free(EVP_PKEY *x) 
{
    if (x == NULL) return;
	
    int i;
    CRYPTO_DOWN_REF(&x->references, &i, x->lock);
    REF_PRINT_COUNT("EVP_PKEY", x);

    if (i > 0) return;
    
    REF_ASSERT_ISNT(i < 0);
    evp_pkey_free_it(x);
#ifndef FIPS_MODULE
    CRYPTO_free_ex_data(CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_EVP_PKEY, x, &x->ex_data);
#endif
    CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free(x->lock);
#ifndef FIPS_MODULE
    sk_X509_ATTRIBUTE_pop_free(x->attributes, X509_ATTRIBUTE_free);
#endif
    OPENSSL_free(x);
}

This version of EVP_PKEY_free() function aims to clean up the code, eliminate multiple indentation levels making it simpler. 

Well-structured code allows easier reading and understanding, making it more likely that it will be used and maintained correct.

In the restructured code:
- Checking x for NULL is performed as very first operation allowing the function to terminate at the earliest point when fed with invalid input.
    
- Declaration & initialization of variable 'i' is moved next to first point of its usage for better readability and consistency of coding practice.

- Original nested if-else structure is flattened which simplly reduce one level of indentation. This makes the code more readable and maintain the same functionality.
