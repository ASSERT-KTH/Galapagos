It seems there it quite the misunderstanding here. Direct translation of this snippet from C to Go isn't feasible, since Go's programming model has significant differences compared to C's (most notably lack of direct memory manipulation capabilities in Go). Moreover, the usage of openssl/BIGNUM libraries in this extract - Go's standard library simply doesn't offer such functionality by default.

Golang based implementation would rely either on bigint package provided by Go's standard library (math/big) or a separate 3rd party library that mimics openssl functionality more closely. However this may introduce auxiliary objects or methods and might not maintain the original function's signature, as Go is very different language than C. 

Regardless, math/big API already provides receiver methods bound directly to a bigint object (like Add for addition), so a translation might even be unnecessary. I suggest to revise your question based on need, as it currently asking for something syntactically equivalent but it's not possible due to semantic incompatibilities between two different languages.
