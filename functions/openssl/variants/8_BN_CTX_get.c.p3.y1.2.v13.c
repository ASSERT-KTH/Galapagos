As the semantics of Go and C are quite different, translating this code literally into Go won't be useful because some of concepts don't exist such as BIGNUM, BN_CTX, and the ways Go and C handle error are totally different.

However, on the basis of understanding the C code above, here's a rough equivalent in Go that keeps the same structure and logic wherever possible. Please note that, without knowing more about the purpose of CTXDBG, BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES, BN_POOL_get, or the expected behavior for the two flags (ctx.TooMany and ret.Flags), it may not be 100% equivalent function.

go
type Bignum struct {
    Flags int
}

type BN_CTX struct {
    ErrStack string
    TooMany  bool
    Pool     *Bignum
    Used     int
    Flags    int
}

func BN_CTX_get(ctx *BN_CTX) *Bignum {
    var ret *Bignum

    if ctx.ErrStack != "" || ctx.TooMany {
        return nil
    }

    ret = ctx.Pool

    if ret == nil {
        ctx.TooMany = true
        // Call Function on Your Error Library with appropriate error
        return nil
    }

    ret.Flags = 0
    ret.Flags &= ^int(^0 << 1)
    ctx.Used++

    return ret
}


Please tailor this as per your usage while transition from C to Go along with considering Go specific concepts, error handling, methods etc. Also, correct understanding of C code structures and logic will help you in correct and meaningful translation to Go.
