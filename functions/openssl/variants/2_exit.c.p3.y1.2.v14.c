It's not exactly possible to create a semantically equivalent version of the given C function in Go due to certain constraints. Go does not support direct system calls like 'dlsym' or 'select', raising system errors in these situations, and in addition it does not support function pointers in the same way as C does. Modifications or wrapping into higher abstraction level may need to be made.

But, a rough equivalent of the 'exit' function, ignoring the delay implemented by 'select' and the indirect call through 'dlsym', would look like this in Go:

go
import (
    "os"
    "time"
)

func exit(status int) {
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    os.Exit(status)
}


Note that itâ€™s not directly equivalent and might not satisfy some specific intention in the original C code. Any proper emulation of "select" and "dlsym" functionality would probably require custom implementations with Go's system call package (syscall) or cgo function calls to a C library, moving away from idiomatic Go, and introducing significantly more complexity to the function. That sort of verbatim translation is not generally recommended when porting code between languages differing significantly such as C and Go.
