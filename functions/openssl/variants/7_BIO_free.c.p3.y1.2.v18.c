This has a slight adaptation of the use of exiting errors on issues happened when a critical step not success; also added explicit ignoring of existence callbacks only if none is found. All these are idiomatic developments handle errors in golang using famous golangâ€™s error handling. In addition, the acquire data reference management explicitly organized with no any efficient cryptographic library exist equivalent managements.

This migration only provided semantics equivalences because imperative style C core functionalities say reference management, lock synchronization, memory allocations/free management related does not exists corresponding ones from higher level languages directly (Including golang). They are implicitly handled by language runtime itself better and safer ways.

**Remember**

Always call `defer Unlock()` after calling this `Lock()`, not necessary in use manual lock declaration as `CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free` explicit called recognize in C code. Same applied to allocation/scope/automatic spaces management for a variable.

**Can be added**

The thread safety of Reference Tracker can be elaborate of using the `atomic package instead of a mutex`

Remember, go does not advocate functions that can fail without returning an error. A proceeding from the job with negligence way of current behaviour it secretly hidden on 0 flag indicator. Consider properly propagating failures up to the caller to handle and report to end-user correspondingly.
