One possible variant might be to randomize the amount of delay before the exit is triggered (instead of always 0.1 second) within some acceptable range as the specific delay timing may not be central to the function's main functionality. Additionally, error handling can be added to ensure the 'exit' symbol was actually retrieved successfully.


#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

void exit(int status)
{
    void (*realexit)(int);
    struct timeval tv;
    
    /* Randomize between 0.05 second and 0.15 second.*/
    srand((unsigned int)time(NULL));
    int rand_usec = 50000 + rand()%100000;
 
    tv.tv_sec = 0;
    tv.tv_usec = rand_usec;
    
    realexit = (void (*)(int))dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "exit");
    if (realexit == NULL)
    {
        fputs(dlerror(), stderr);
        return;
    } 
    select(0, 0, 0, 0, &tv);
    realexit(status);
}

This modified version now randomizes the delay before actual termination and checks if the symbol retrieval process was successful.
