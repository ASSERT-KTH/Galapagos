In Go, we do not have classes like C++. So, we can define an instance of CN_CTX as a struct and can define methods related to that struct. As there is no representation for ERR_raise, we can use the errors package in Go. For bitwise operations, Go supports these operations in a similar manner to C.

go
package main

import "errors"

type BIGNUM struct {
	Flags int
}

type BN_CTX struct {
	errStack  bool
	tooMany   bool
	pool      *int
	flag      int
	BIGNUM    *BIGNUM
	used  int
}

const (
	BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES = "Too many temporary variables"
	BN_FLG_CONSTTIME                  = 1
)


func BN_CTX_get(ctx *BN_CTX) (*BIGNUM, error) {
	if ctx.errStack || ctx.tooMany {
		return nil, nil
	}

	var res *BIGNUM
	res = BN_POOL_get(*ctx)

	if res == nil {
		ctx.tooMany = true;
		return nil, errors.New(BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES)
	}

	res.Flags = 0
	res.Flags &=^ BN_FLG_CONSTTIME

	ctx.used++

	return res, nil
}

func BN_POOL_get(ctx BN_CTX) *BIGNUM {
	// Assume this function retrieves a BIGNUM from the pool 
	// Based on the ctx flags  and pool int ptr.
	// Similar to the C Version Code logic.
}


Please Note that these chunks of code are to set a style around the logic implemented in `C` coding lanugage. Without knowing about the definition and logic behind `CTTXDBG(),ERR_raise(), BN_POOL_get()` people can't move them in their full integrity into `go` language from language `C` which are indeed depend on `OpenSSL C library`.
