Due to fundamental differences between C and Go, you can't directly map C's variable argument functions to Go because Go does not support varargs like the ones presented on the function. ‘…’ in Go is not similar to ‘...’ in C. Therefore, exact semantic match for the function signature is not directly possible. But the functionality can be represented slightly different way:

go
import(
    "strconv"
)

func com_err(whoami string, code int, fmt string, a ...interface{}) {} 
    errCode := strconv.Itoa(code)
    formattedArgs := fmt.Sprint(a...)  // format the extra arguments according to your needs
    messageFormatter := whoami +" "+ errcode +" "+ fmtZ
``

This new `com_err` function symbolizes the elemental resemblance to the C version you provided adjusted to language-specific constraints. Given that Go is a static language, it's also noteworthy that you'll have to know ahead of time what kind of cases may be passed into your Go function, which could mean refactoring your original function. }
