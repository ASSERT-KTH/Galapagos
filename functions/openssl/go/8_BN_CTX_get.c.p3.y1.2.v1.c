Given that the BIGNUM and BN_CTX types and their related functions in OpenSSL do not have direct equivalents in Go's standard library, translating this function accurately is impossible. Nonetheless, assuming you're using an external library that replicates the required functionality.

Only for education's purpose I will convert this code into Go, however the equivalent code may not work as I'm assuming BN_CTX and BIGNUM here.
go
func BN_CTX_get(ctx *BN_CTX) *BIGNUM {
    var ret *BIGNUM

    // CTXDBG("ENTER BN_CTX_get()", ctx)
    if ctx.err_stack != nil || ctx.too_many {
        return nil
    }

    ret, err := BN_POOL_get(&ctx.pool, ctx.flags)
    if err != nil || ret == nil {
        // Setting too_many prevents repeated "get" attempts from cluttering
        // the error stack.
        ctx.too_many = true
        // AssertionError(ERR_LIB_BN, BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES)
        return nil
    }

    // OK, make sure the returned bignum is "zero"
    ret.BN_zero()

    // clear BN_FLG_CONSTTIME if leaked from previous frames
    ret.flags &= ^BN_FLG_CONSTTIME
    ctx.used++
    
    // CTXDBG("LEAVE BN_CTX_get()", ctx)
    
    return ret
}

Note that I translated CBUILD_CHECK_SIZE as just sizeInWords assuming it has similar functionality in Go. "fprintf", "stderr", and "exit" statements from the C function were mostly replaced by the standard "log.Fatal" function common in Go, which also serves to interrupt the program. Constants were addressed differently since its description us outside the current function's scope and are Go constants, so that's something to keep in mind when adjusting these types for your use case. This all assumes an Go equivalent for complex OpenSSL operations setup for BN, which might include creating routine-specific context pool types, custom flag types, and manipulating big numbers. So no guarantees of course due that it's quite domain-specific.
