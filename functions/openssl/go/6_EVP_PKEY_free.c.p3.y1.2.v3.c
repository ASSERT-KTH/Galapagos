It's pivotal to understand that the process of turning C language to Go isn't an immediate one. Since cryptography-related operations are found straight away in standard libraries for both languages, the code naturally would be different. Different threading models and memory management also complicate translation. 

Considering the above constraints; this code snippet below is a primitive "replica"â€”performing similar functionalities when relevant cryptographic packages and methods are supposedly implemented akin in the existing in C function.

One also should note that the Go programming language doesn't involve any deterministic freeing of allocations, unlike in C programming language. Memory management is managed via the GC in Go.

go
package main

import (
//Import Relevant Cypto Packages here
)

func EVP_PKEY_free(x *EVP_PKEY) {
    var i int

    if x == nil {
        return
    }

    x.References, i = cryptoDownRef(x.References, i, x.Lock)
    if i > 0 {
        return
    }
    if !(i < 0) {
        evp_pkey_free_it(x)
    }
    x.ExData = cryptoFreeExData(x.ExData)
    x.Lock = cryptoThreadLockFree(x.Lock)
    openSSLFree(x)
}


Please make sure these imports and method names exists in your domain specific packages for cryptography as this Go method conversion literally cannot be achieved if similar objects and methods are not present in your cryptography library. C interoperability with Go when it's related to system libraries is tricky with no straightforward translations and can deviate a lot context-wise. 

Remember that explicit `free` functionality called upon cryptographic objects are less meaningful in Go for the aforementioned reasons. Also complex multi-threading efforts can usually be by-passed through Goroutines offering lightweight, sophisticated handler parallel executions. However, exact intentions should always be verified and performance thoroughly tested. Ensure to follow communities like `crypto.io` and Go's `golang-nuts` for advanced use-cases and optimizations featuring standard libraries in important security-conscious areas.
