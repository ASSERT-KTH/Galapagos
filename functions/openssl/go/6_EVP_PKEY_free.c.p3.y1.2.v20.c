Consider the fact that OpenSSL and its APIs are written in C language using structures and memory management techniques that (e.g., pointers, memory allocation/free, manual reference counting) that are vastly different from that are present in a Go environment.

Translation of such interfaces tends not only to be inaccurate due to absence of such features in Go, but also recommends some sort of C to Go interfacing to leverage libraries such as OpenSSL.

In light of the point stated above, provided below is a hypothetical Go implementation that inherently avoids extensive API translation.

Go
import "C"
// We need cgo to interface with C OpenSSL libraries.

type EVP_PKEY C.struct_EVP_PKEY

func EVP_PKEY_free(e *EVP_PKEY) {
  if e == nil {
    return
  }
  
  var i C.int
  
  C.CRYPTO_DOWN_REF(&e.references, &i, e.lock)
  if i > 0 {
    return
  }
  C.evp_pkey_free_it(e)

  // Assuming CRYPTO_free_ex_data, etc. to exist in the associated OpenSSL context,
  // bindings via cgo
  C.CRYPTO_free_ex_data(C.CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_EVP_PKEY, e, &e.ex_data)
  C.CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free(e.lock)
  C.sk_X509_ATTRIBUTE_pop_free(e.attributes, C.X509_ATTRIBUTE_free)
  C.OPENSSL_free(e)
}

  
Note that attempting to translate such a code from a C environment to a Go one while maintaining full semantic unity may not be practically feasible. The CKMS OpenSSL interfaces for cryptographic functionality are complex with constructs that are deeply ingrained in raw C and operating system memory management mechanisms.
Kindly consider alternatives for cryptography in Go such as the module 'crypto/tls' which provides TLS and SSL protocol versions thrived implementations. Furthermore, Google's Project Wycheproof has fully implemented cryptographic library tests. There are also libraries such as libgodium providing Go language bindings. They are worth considering in cryptographic contexts. For working with OpenSSL in Go, one might need a cgo interface keeping in mind the lifetimes, errors, memory management would be an incredibly tedious endeavor.
