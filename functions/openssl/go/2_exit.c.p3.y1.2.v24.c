Due to the nature of Golang and C, a completely semantically equivalent version cannot be made. The `dlsym` function exists to dynamically load libc functions at runtime, which doesn't have a trivial Go equivalent. Yet closest can be translated as follows:

go
package main
import (
    "time"
    "os"
)

func exit(status int) {
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    os.Exit(status)
}


In Go, there's no need to get a handle to the `os.Exit` function as we would have to in C. InvalidOperationException
