Unlike C, the Go programming language uses garbage collector for memory management, so there's typically no direct equivalent for freeing allocated objects in the same way we typically see in C. Consequently, a function designed to "free" an object really don't mean much in Go. However, what I can do is mimicking equivalent of certain parts from the provided C code in Go on the assumption that `BIO` is a struct and implementation of several undefined functions are available.

go
type BIO struct {
    References int
    Method     *Method
    ExData     interface{}
    Lock       *sync.Mutex
    Callback   func(BIO int, state int, param1, param2, param3, param4 int64) int
}

type Method struct {
    Destroy func(*BIO)
}

func BiocallCallback(a *BIO, params ...int64) int {
    return a.Callback(BIO_CB_FREE, 1, params...)
}

func (a *BIO) BIOFree() int {
    var ret int
    if a == nil {
        return 0
    }
    if a.Lock != nil {
        a.Lock.Lock()
        defer a.Lock.Unlock()
    }
    a.References--
    ret = a.References
    if ret > 0 {
        return 1
    }
    
    if a.Callback != nil {
        ret = BiocallCallback(a, 0, 0, 0, 0)
        if ret <= 0 {
            return 0
        }
    }
    if a.Method != nil && a.Method.Destroy != nil {
        a.Method.Destroy(a)
    }
    a.ExData = nil   // crypto_free_ex_data Mock destruction here by setting it to no data
    a.Lock = nil
    a = nil    // OPENSSL_free(a)
    return 1
}

Above code defines `BIO` as a struct and attempts to "free" this struct by setting values to `nil` ('free' from usage, thoughnot from memory-- that's the language GC's job to deal with it!). It also mimics decrementing reference count shown in C function.
