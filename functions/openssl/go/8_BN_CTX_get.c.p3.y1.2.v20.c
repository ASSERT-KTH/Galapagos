Given that Go does not support classes or class methods (like those used in the provided C code) and does not exactly follow the C standards, it's not quite possible to render a direct 1:1 translation of this function. This could potentially introduce some errors or oversights. With those challenges in mind, the suggested semantically similar Go code is:

go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"math/big"
)

type BNCTX struct {
	ErrStack bool
	TooMany  bool
	Pool     *big.Int
	Flags    uint
	Used     int
}

func BNCTXGet(ctx *BNCTX) (*big.Int, error) {
	var ret *big.Int
	if ctx.TooMany || ctx.ErrStack {
		return nil, errors.New("too many processing conflicts in the context were encountered")
	}
    // Go doesn't support a direct alternative of BN_POOL_get function. They will need to be implemented manually.
    // ret = BN_POOL_get(ctx.Pool, ctx.Flags)  
	if ret == nil {
		ctx.TooMany = true
		return nil, errors.New("too many temporary variables")
	}

	// Set value to zero
	ret = new(big.Int)

	ctx.Flags &^= BN_FLG_CONSTTIME
	ctx.Used++
	return ret, nil
}


Please note the implementation of BN_POOL_get( ) function is application-specific requirement, which needs to be created. 

In Go, errors rather than null & an error code in OpenSSL, are commonly returned after failure of functions. That's why we return an error as well as the `res` in the function signature.
