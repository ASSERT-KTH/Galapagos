In Go, operations like free are automatically performed by garbage collector and hence cannot be implemented exactly like C code. However, we do provide a function here that mimics similar functionality to show recreation in Go language which ensures to close and destroy any interface if they satisfy certain conditions.

Note that lock, free-type and destroy-like operations are not working the same as C in Go and we cannot drop down to lowest level by just calling those operations in Go, so this code is a conceptual diagram rather equivalent and no actual alternative exists.

Also, Go does not support implicit interface implementation, instead it uses explicit. So we have to declare a Destroyer interface for those types which have a destroy method.

go
type Destroyer interface {
    Destroy(a *BIO) error
}

type Callbacker interface {
    CallCallback() error
}

type BIO struct {
    references int
    method     *Method
    lock       *sync.Mutex
    exData     interface{}
}

type Method struct {
    CanDestroy bool
}

func freeBIO(a *BIO) int {
    if a == nil {
        return 0
    }
    a.lock.Lock()
    if a.references <= 0 {
        a.lock.Unlock()
        return 0
    }
    a.references--

    if m, ok := a.method.(Destroyer); ok && m.CanDestroy {
        err := m.Destroy(a)
        if err != nil {
            a.lock.Unlock()
            return 0
        }
    }

    if _, ok := a.method.(Callbacker); ok {
        err := a.method.(Callbacker).CallCallback()
        if err != nil {
            return 0
        }
    }

    a.lock.Unlock()
    
    runtime.SetFinalizer(a, nil) // drop any finalizers.
    
    a = nil  // can help trigger the runtime's garbage collector as soon as convenient.
    
    return 1
}

In addition, even though this Go version is less primitive than the C version, the notion of it should remain the same, such as checking whether the parameter is nil or not, the availability of methods at operations with further error handling, and applying proper concurrency permission handling. 

Please, use it as a guide or starting point and modify to fit it with your actual use-case and setup.
