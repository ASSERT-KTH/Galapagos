Go does not have direct equivalents for many of these C functions. For instance, the `dlsym` function retrieves the address of a symbol in a dynamic library, but Go does not support runtime dynamic linking in the same way, due to its design philosophy of static linking. Similarly, Go's multithreading model and native support for sleep make use of the `select` function unnecessary.

Thus, a rough approximation in Go might look like the following:

go
import (
	"os"
	"time"
)

func exit(status int) {
	time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
	os.Exit(status)
}


This code does not utilize an equivalent to dlsym and the select function since these are not available in the Go programming language. Instead, it uses the native `os.Exit` function in Go to terminate the process immediately with the specified status code.
