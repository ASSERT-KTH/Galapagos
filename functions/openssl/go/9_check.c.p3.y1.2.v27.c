Unfortunately, as far as I know, there isn't a direct equivalent in Go for the krb5 library that the C code uses, mostly because Go typically would handle these concepts differently.

However, you can achieve roughly same functionality in error checking with a selection of Go's concepts and net/http or its more powerful variants.

Since you mentioned to maintain the original function's signature, here's a simple reference version:

You'd most likely return the error if an error exists instead of utilizing assertions and panics like this would.

Anyway, error can get chained using `fmt.Errorf` wherein we can add more context to an error and `errors.As` checks if the current underlying type matches with the error type we think it might be.

go
import (
	"fmt"
    "errors"
)

type Krb5Error struct {
	Code int
}

func (e *Krb5Error) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("KRB5 error with code: %d", e.Code)
}

func check(err error) {
	if err != nil {
		var krb5Err *Krb5Error

        if errors.As(err, &krb5Err) {
           fmt.Println(krb5Err)
        }

        panic(err)
    }
}


The code above creates a Krb5Error struct that adheres to the `error` interface in Go. The `check` function participates in Go's common idiom in which functions return an error and then the caller decides how to handle that error. Here `check` rises a panic if it receives a non-nil error. 

In similar approach, we can assert errors in common way just like an "The Go Way".

Hope this helps you. Let me know if you have any further questions, happy coding!

*Note: Rising panic in go is usually discouraged unless the error is non recoverable. So instead of panic you might want to handle errors as per all the available information regarding to the error in your application.*
