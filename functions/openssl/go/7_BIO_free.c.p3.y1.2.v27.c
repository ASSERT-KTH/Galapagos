It's not possible to transliterate this C code to Go without some assumptions because C and Go handle things like error handling and memory management differently due to their language design philosophies. Required dependencies that don't provide their Go variants (e.g., `BIO`, `CRYPTO_DOWN_REF()`, `BIO_CB_FREE`, etc.) make the situation more complicated.

However, with a few assumptions about similar behavior, we can create a code that tracks the spirit of what your C code was trying to achieve:

go
import (
	"errors"
	"sync"
)

type BIO struct {
	lock       sync.Mutex
	references int
	method     *BIO_Method
}

type BIO_Method struct {
	destroy func(*BIO)
}

func BIO_free(a *BIO) error {
	if a == nil {
		return nil
	}

	a.lock.Lock()
	if a.references--; a.references > 0 {
		a.lock.Unlock()
		return nil
	}

	if a.method != nil && a.method.destroy != nil {
		a.method.destroy(a)
	}
	a.lock.Unlock()

	// No OpenSSL analogues in Go. They are not needed as Go has garbage collector
	// CRYPTO_free_ex_data(CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_BIO, a, &a->ex_data);
	// CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free(a->lock);
	// OPENSSL_free(a);

	return nil
}

Depending upon the original behavior of `BIO_free()`, this Go code might be incorrect.

The Go Guide:"The Go Programming Language does not provide explicit control over the computer's memory and has a garbage collector. Hence, features like free and destroy and all security features(dependencies) associated with it, are not available in Go."
