Given that the provided C code is very low-level and uses OpenSSL, creating a direct translation into Go isn't really feasible as Go's standard library attempts to prioritize cross-platform applicability over raw performance. 

Still, I will try to implement the function conceptually in large scale. Highlights of what is happening in this function:

- We have reference counting, according to the interactions with `CRYPTO_DOWN_REF`, which seems to increment a reference, and to end reference once count becomes 0
- Checking for callbacks and executing them
- Freeing up the data associated with `BIO`
- Releasing a lock, presumably for multi-threading
- Free the `BIO` struct pointer itself using `OPENSSL_Free` 

Assuming there will be similar functions for GO, according to open source community libraries; the implementation would probably look something like this in the broad scheme:

Go
import (
    crypto "crypto"
)

type Bio struct {
    references int
    method     *Method
    lock       *sync.Mutex
    exData     interface{}
}

type Method struct {
    destroy func(*Bio)
}

func FreeBio(a *Bio) int {
    var ret int

    if a == nil {
        return 0
    }

    a.lock.Lock()
    a.references--
    ret = a.references
    a.lock.Unlock()

    if a.references > 0 {
        return 1
    }
    if a.references < 0 {
        panic("Bio references count less than zero!")
    }
    shouldKeep := callDestroy(a)

    if !shouldKeep {
        if a.method != nil && a.method.destroy != nil {
            a.method.destroy(a)
        }

        a.exData = nil

        a.lock = nil

        // no equivalent in GO for OPENSSL_free(), since this 
        // operations is handled by the garbage collector in GO
        a = nil 
    }
}

func callDestroy(a *Bio) bool {
    keepAlive := true
    // Assuming there
    // - is some kind of callback in the instance or possibly a global callback
    // - is some method retrieving that callback implemented somewhere or 
    if callback, isCallback := getDestroyCallback(a); isCallback {
        // Assuming callback decides whether the struct should be destroyed
        // or retained for possible later reuse
        keepAlive = callback(a) 
    }
    return keepAlive
}


This code allocates some assumptions like the callback returns a bool which could depend on some other condition and not all aspects of the C code are implemented due to a lack of similar functions in Golang.API we have considered some assumptions to give a struct-instance related idea based on locking and methods invoking. Please dedicate lookout for the alternatives with outlining for feasible solutions within the project scope.
