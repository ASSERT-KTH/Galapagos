In Go, we do not have direct control over memory management like in C. Additionally, `EVP_PKEY_free` is very specific to the OpenSSL library which does not have a direct Go equivalent library. Hence we cannot precisely replicate this low-level function with same semantics in Go since memory management and other operations are handled by Go's inbuilt garbage collector and OpenSSL libraries work at the system level interfacing with Network protocols & SSL/TLS bounds which might use a completely different underpinning in GoLang.

However assuming simplified functionality of this function in high-level Go might make it comparable as managing references to simplify we can assume counting references and removing according to garbage collection. It still won't be parallel equivalent but for hint a certain simplification in Go:

The equivalent Go function might look something as shown below:

go
import (
"sync"
)

type EVP_PKEY struct {
	lock       *sync.Mutex
	references int
	attributes []X509_ATTRIBUTE
}

var i = 1

func evp_pkey_free_it(x *EVP_PKEY) {
  // assuming this function simplifies the minimisation of attribute values.
	x.attributes = nil
}

func EVP_PKEY_free(x *EVP_PKEY) {
	if x == nil {
		return
	}

	x.lock.Lock()

	x.references--

	i := x.references
	x.lock.Unlock()

	if i > 0 {
		return
	}
	evp_pkey_free_it(x)
    x = nil  /// suggested way in go for cleaning.
}


Note that the parts of the original function contained within `#ifndef FIPS_MODULE` were not replicated because Go doesn't have a preprocessor or comparable functionality to compile parts of the code conditionally.

Please note memory and other resources control isn't exactly similar as in C. Go does it automatically so most of the time explicit freeing isn't needed. Please modify according to need.
