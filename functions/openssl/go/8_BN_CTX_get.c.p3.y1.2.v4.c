In Go, the function may look like this. Note that due to differences between C and Go there are some details that cannot be translated directly such as memory allocation and error handling:

go
func BN_CTX_get(ctx *BN_CTX) *BIGNUM {
    ctxDebug("ENTER BN_CTX_get()", ctx)
    if ctx.errStack || ctx.tooMany {
        return nil
    }
    ret, err := BN_POOL_get(&ctx.pool, ctx.flags)
    if err != nil {
        ctx.tooMany = true
        // ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_BN, BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES)
        return nil
    }

    // Ensure the returned BIGNUM is set to zero
    BN_zero(ret)

    // Clear BN_FLG_CONSTTIME if leaked from previous frames
    ret.flags &^= BN_FLG_CONSTTIME
    ctx.used++
    ctxDebug("LEAVE BN_CTX_get()", ctx)
    return ret
}


This go code is semantically equivalent or as close as possible due to differences between the languages. Much of the difference between this and the original function come down to several key factors:

- Go is garbage-collected and does not have explicit handling for memory like C does, hence we can simply create and return our values without needing to worry about exactly when they will be deallocated.
- Go does not have error numbers, typically errors will be their own types implementing the error interface. This usually allows us to provide more information than a simple number. So `ERR_raise` doesn't have a clear analogue.
  
- The way bitwise operators are used may differ between c and go, hence you may need to adjust it based on your definition and requirements.
  
Overall, as C and Go are quite different languages, not everything transfers over perfectly, and this function will look fairly different.
