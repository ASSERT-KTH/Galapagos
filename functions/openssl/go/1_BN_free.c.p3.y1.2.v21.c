Unfortunately, we can't convert the function entirely to Go without the function definitions of `BN_get_flags`, `bn_free_d`, `OPENSSL_free` since these are C-specific functions. Also, the way to handle pointers or free memory is way different from Go compared to C-language.

However, below is a rough pseudocode-style conversion in Go:

go
import (
	"unsafe"
)

type BIGNUM struct {
	Flags    int
	StaticData int
	Malloced int
}

func BNFree(a *BIGNUM) {
	if a == nil {
		return
	}
	if !BN_get_flags(a, BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA) {
		bn_free_d(a, 0)
	}
	if a.Flags & BN_FLG_MALLOCED {
		OPENSSL_free(a)
	}                     
}


Again, this isn't true Go code, but may give you a rough idea how the original sample is converted. As mentioned above, the Go language has its own garbage collector which does the memory management, hence does not offer equivalent functionality to "free" a malloc'd structure or block of memory as in C-language directly. The Go garbage collector automatically reclaims memory when no more references to it exist.

Functions `BN_get_flags`, `bn_free_d(a, 0)`, `OPENSSL_free(a)` are used from C-language, their support directly is not there in Go. For their Go equivalent mechanism, we have to see their implementations in C. For that more context is needed.
