In the Go programming language, the equivalent function might look something like this:

go
import (
    "crypto/big"
)

func BN_free(a *big.Int) {
    if a == nil {
        return
    }
    if !BN_get_flags(a, BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA){
        bn_free_d(a, 0)
    }
    if (a.Flags & BN_FLG_MALLOCED) != 0 {
        a = nil
    }
}


Note: This code won't compile in real situation, because `big.Int` doesn't have any `Flags` filed or any equivalent of `Flags` or its associated constants like `BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA` or `BN_FLG_MALLOCED` in Go's big package said function and constants are usually openSSL specific.
In common scenario you usually don't need to release / clean / free memory in Go as we used to in languages like C, due to Go's intrinsic garbage collector. Memory not referred is auto released by GC. For finite field arithmetic calculations Go provides big package to handle large numbers.
