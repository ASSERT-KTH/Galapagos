The provided function is written in C and depends on the OpenSSL library which provides structures and methods for working with big numbers (like `BIGNUM`, `BN_CTX`, `BN_POOL_get()` and `BN_zero()`. Also it uses specific macros such as `ERR_raise` for error reporting. Unfortunately direct conversion of this function to Go isn't possible because we don't have these methods, data structures, and macros in Go and besides that Go doesn't support operations with pointers as it is used in C.

However, you can achieve the handling of big integers in Go language using "math/big" package in quite different way. Here is some very general illustrative example of a function that might correspond to the given C code, but it is not semantically equivalent as such a conversion is not possible:

Go
import (
    "math/big"
    "fmt"
    "errors"
)

type BN_CTX struct {
    number big.Int
    // ... other necessary fields
}

func BN_CTX_get(ctx *BN_CTX) (*big.Int, error) {
    if ctx == nil || // handle for ctx.falseCondition1 || ctx.exceededLimit {
        return nil, errors.New("Invalid context")
    }
    
    ret := big.NewInt(0)
    ret.Set(&ctx.number)

    // Perform operations equivalent to C functions
    ret.SetInt64(0) // equivalent to BN_zero(ret);
    ctx.used ++ // Perform equivalent operation on context

    if !ret.IsFalseConditionExample() { // = BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES
        return nil, errors.New("Too many temporary variables")
    }

    // Return big int pointer and no error
    return ret, nil 
}

Please replace "used", "falseCondition1" and other pseudo code with real symbols used in your BN_CTX struct and the logic of the function accordingly. This example defines the BN_CTX type and respective function in Go but it's struct and error codes are only illustrative.
