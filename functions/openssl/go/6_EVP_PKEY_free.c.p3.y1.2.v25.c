Unfortunately, it isn't possible to create a semantically equivalent function in Go for `EVP_PKEY_free` as given in the question.

This function is clearly using the OpenSSL API from C. The OpenSSL library provides robust and comprehensive features for dealing with SSL and TLS communication protocols, as well as full-strength general purpose cryptography libraries. In this specific function, we are doing some manipulation & cleanup over `EVP_PKEY ` structures, which is a structure present in OpenSSL for storing different types of key - RSA, DSA, EC, etc.

Go doesn't offer the ability to directly use C APIs or calling conventions and because of this you cannot directly convert many OpenSSL API calls to Go.

You may however; use `cgo`, a feature in Go that allows to create bindings to C libraries, or you choose to go with Go native libraries as alternatives to OpenSSL. For SSL/TLS communications for example, Go already has a strong native package called "crypto/tls".

Therefore, please consider revising your use-case about needing to translate this function literally, as you have much easier and safer options within purely native Go code.
