Unfortunately, it is not possible to create the exact conversion of the function in Go without changing its structure because variadic functions in C are quite complex.

Particularly, The C function `com_err` provided accepts variable arguments (`...`). Go also supports variadic functions but these two are not semantically equivalent. 

In Go, We cannot directly handle variadic function parameters as easily as it is done in C while using functions like `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end`. 

Mandatory modifications have to be in place when attempting to create a `com_err` function in Go. 

An alternative approach with different function arguments structure is attached below,

go
import (
    "fmt"
)

func ComErr(whoami string, code int, msg ...interface{}) {
	formattedMessage := fmt.Sprint(msg...)
	fmt.Println(whoami, code, formattedMessage)
}


Note that the error handling practices and messages displaying manners in Go are usually handled differently from how they're handled in C. 

This can be a feasible translation of the `com_err` to Go that semantically achieves relatively similar results. The direct equivalent doesn't exist, unfortunately.
