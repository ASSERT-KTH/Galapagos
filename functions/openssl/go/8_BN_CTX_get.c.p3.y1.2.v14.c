Translating a C code snippet to Go can be a direct or intricate challenge. In this case, 'BN_CTX_get' is a function that's not a generic C function -- it's native to the OpenSSL library to handle "Big Numbers" -- BIGNUMs. It fundamentally involves Memory management that C does without frills while Go prevents doing the same for safety reasons.

We cannot create a syntactical 'BN_CTX_get' equivalent in Go since Go intentionally abstracts out this kind of direct memory management specifics to prevent complex, error-prone tasks. Go provides a "big" package for precision-sensitive mathematical operations.

Go doesn't need NULL returns for error conditions, instead it suggests using built-in error mechanisms. 

Here is an aproximate demonstration how to work with big integers on a high-level, less detail - hence safer - in Go:

go
package main

import (
    "math/big"
)

type BN_CTX struct {
    ErrStack, TooMany  bool
    Pool               *big.Int
    Used               int
    Flags              big.Int
}

func BN_CTX_get(ctx *BN_CTX) *big.Int {
    if ctx.ErrStack || ctx.TooMany {
        return nil
    }
    var ret = new(big.Int)
    ret = ctx.Pool
    if(ret == nil){
    	ctx.TooMany = true
    	return nil
    }
    ret.SetInt64(0)
    // clear BN_FLG_CONSTTIME if leaked from previous frames
    ret.AndNot(ret, &ctx.Flags)
    ctx.Used++
    return ret
}

Since there are no direct equivalents of 'CTXDBG', 'BN_POOL_get', 'ERR_raise', 'BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES', 'BN_zero', 'BN_FLG_CONSTTIME' and '(&BN_FLG_CONSTTIME)' in Go or its standard library packages, they've been omitted. Also, direct in-memory operations and errors can be managed with other paradigms in Go, such as channels for thread-safe, linear execution.

On a different train of thought such complex libraries have there own well architectured-wrapper libraries in Go such as OpenSSL wrapper "crypto" library in Go which we can use but it would not be an ideal solution. Due to abstraction and secret handling, complexity is automatically hidden and involves management semantics conveniently, like automatic garbage collection, instead of explicit deallocation we often do in languages like C or C++.
