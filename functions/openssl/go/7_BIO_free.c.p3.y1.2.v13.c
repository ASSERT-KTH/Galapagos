Translating C code to Go can often require reshaping the code dramatically due to differences in language features and paradigms, especially when dealing with low-level operations and direct manipulations of memory. And In this case, moving the code from C to Go isn't feasible at all due to several reasons:

1. The replaceable `BIO` method - Different method implementations can be set on a `BIO`, and this method structure varies. Certainly, a function pointer field like `destroy`, might have more than one distinct implementation, depending on the specific attributes of a particular `BIO` instance.

2. C function*/method pointers - Go doesn't support them.

3. C line `(&a->references)` stands for passing an address of field from `struct`. A pointer to memory cell is passed to `CRYPTO_DOWN_REF` program could change this cell's content explicitly. This is impossible in pure Go where transitions are made over a copy of the parameters, rather explicit by value or by reference.

4. Go does not support function overloading, or operator overloading (which isn't used in the C code you provided, but is quite common in C and C++).

Please note that Go was designed with goals in mind that conflict with providing direct control over memory and execution, such as "eliminating unused features" or "Checks are done at compile time and run time".

The only solution out of this requires an interaction between Go and C. This solution lies under a feature of Go called “cgo” that gives Go programs the ability to call C code.

// Here is a short description on how it can be done.

1. With build constraints, using the special comment `// +build cgo`, you tell the Go tool: please compile this file only when CGO_ENABLED=1. A file called `bio.go`.

2. Use pseudo-package "C" in your import block.

3. Including OpenSSL `<openssl/bio.h>` and your personal `custom_bio.h` file in the C header comment.

4. Call C function `BIO_free` in your Go function, using C.CString os.Args[..] to prepare call arguments.

// Example,

Steps 

A. You prepare or convert structures in Go code be for the call, 

B. make the call with wrappers like C.CString (in case there are string arguments),

C. once C.BIO_free does what C.BIO_free does best, your Result = &SyscallResult{ OK... }

D. From `bio.go` you can return anything you like, e.g. standard (res, err) notation.

The semantics change would then be, you receive and prepare parameters for a call that happens in Go, but then you delegate execution in C.

Please note that this solution requires cgo enabled or OpenSSL development files in the path or system. Depending on your situation, this trade-off might or might not be better. 

A optimal solution where it converts C functions to GO without interaction in both languages is unfortunately not possible.
