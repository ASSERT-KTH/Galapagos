In Go, the equivalent function would be:

go
import "crypto/big"

func BnFree(a *big.Int) {
    if a == nil {
        return
    }
    // Assuming the OpenSSl-free and bn_free_d are garbage collection related stuffs,
    // Go automatically handles those.
}


In the original C function, the references about `OPENSSL_free` and `bn_free_d` point respectively to a form of memory management and bigger number freeing methods from OpenSSL. In Go, memory management (and therefore OpenSSL-style manual freeing of memory) isn't needed because Go has garbage collection.

Additionally, the `BN_get_flags` and `BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA` in the original C function could most likely be referring to flag manipulations on the big number to alter or check its state/properties. Goâ€™s standard library doesn't have a like-for-like equivalent for flag checking on `big.Int` objects compared with the OpenSSL big numbers library. The main reason for this is likely because the lower-level state (inclusive of flags highlighting temporary/[im]mutability, etc) of a big number isn't 'exposed' in the public API in the Go library; this is less relevant in Go because there is less instance of having to manually overcome hardware/software manipulations for precision-related efficiency. If it is desired to ensure a big number isn't altered, creating a function-scoped variable would be a reasonable workaround in Go idiomatic code.
