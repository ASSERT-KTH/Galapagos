Translating C code to Go code can't be a 1-to-1 process because of certain language-specific features that Go lacks and due to variables that do not possess similar behavior in Go as in C, especially pointers and error handling. However, we can make an estimation that reproduces the algorithm represented by the given C function.

For this particular case, among the differences:

- `BN_CTX` and `BIGNUM` are some kind of complex data structure, which might not have a direct equivalent in Go or would require existing packages with their behavior.
- There are different ways for structures error handling.
- The pointer arithmetic around the stack isn't addressed because Go doesn't support direct pointer manipulation.
  
Go known equivalent or as much as we can infers from context:

go
type BN_CTX struct{
  err_stack bool 
  too_many bool 
  pool BN_POOL 
  flags int 
  used int
}

type BIGNUM struct {
  flags int
  // Other fields are not used here!
}

func BN_CTX_get(ctx BN_CTX) *BIGNUM {
  var ret BIGNUM
  // Error handling of ctx.err_stack and ctx.too_many
  if ctx.err_stack || ctx.too_many {
    return nil
  }
  
  // Filling the structure. This just for method stub
  if pool.get(&ctx.pool, ctx.flags) == nil {
    // Check if repeated "get" attempts made
    ctx.too_many = true
    //Raises errors (using: errors package of Go) ERR_LIB_BN, BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES
    // would be need, C to go equivalent if ERR_raise its unclear but it will encode error.
    return nil
  }
  
  //Make sure, 'ret' bignum is set to 0
  ret.flags = 0
  
  //Clear BN_FLG_CONSTTIME 
  // if leaked from previous frames(not clear from context.)
  ret.flags &= ^BN_FLG_CONSTTIME
  
  ctx.used++
  
  return &ret 
}

Without access to the definitions (types and behavior) of `BIGNUM`, `BN_CTX`, `BN_POOL_get()`, `CTXDBG()`, `ERR_raise(), its very hard to make the exact implementation that actually compiles and works like the initially provided code, thus the resultant code might not be a well structured or scallable in case of  Go coding techiniques.
