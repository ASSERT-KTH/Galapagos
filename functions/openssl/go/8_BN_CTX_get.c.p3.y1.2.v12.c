It's not possible to write semantically equivalent Go code without knowing the internal structure of `BN_CTX`, `BIGNUM`, and `BN_POOL_get`. Concerning to the pseudo interfaces below,

Here's a possible Go convert without defining the global consts (`BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES`, `ERR_LIB_BN`, `BN_FLG_CONSTTIME`) and `CTxDBV`, `ERR_raise`, `BN_zero` functions:

Assume that `BN_CTX`, `BIGNUM` implementation specification in Golang like this:
go
type BIGNUM struct {
    flags  int
}

type BN_POOL struct {}

type BN_CTX struct {
    pool *BN_POOL
    err_stack, too_many, used bool
    flags  int
}


The BN_CTX_get function would be:

go
func BN_CTX_get(ctx *BN_CTX) *BIGNUM {
    
    // CTXDBG("ENTER BN_CTX_get()", ctx)
    
    if ctx.err_stack || ctx.too_many { return nil }

    ret := BN_POOL_get(ctx.pool, ctx.flags)
    
    if ret == nil {
        ctx.too_many = true
        // ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_BN, BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES)
        return nil
    }
    
    // BN_zero(ret)

    ret.flags &^= BN_FLG_CONSTTIME 
    ctx.used++
    // CTXDBG("LEAVE BN_CTX_get()", ctx)

    return ret
}

func BN_POOL_get(pool *BN_POOL, flags int) *BIGNUM{
    // assume that we've a method structure which actually runs & returns big number.
     return &BIGNUM{}
}

Also bear these points in mind:

- You can't directly translate this code into Go, due to the differences between C and Go particularly concerning pointers. The given C code relies heavily on pointer semantics which aren't present in Go's simple, but different, pointer functionality.

- In the example I've created placeholders for potential dependency function and assuming possible underlying methods, but in Go context those might be designed in completely different manner.

Note that, in Go you need to avoid null value comparing as the C does pointer operation, you must check length of an slice before you do activities on it.

This is a good start for understanding the potential complexities and challenges in translating C code into Go, but without more context this might still leave some scenarios not properly covered. Please leverage Golang specific features instead of implementing in similar way of doing in C. The code will might encounter boxing/unboxing movements over pointers of wrappers. 

- Seek more advice from relevant Go communities to create reliable business programs that overcome those huddles wisely.

- We purposely skipped to provide implementation for `BN_POOL_get(), BN_zero(), CTXDBG("ENTER BN_CTX_get()", ctx)` to keep solution considering about the available information i hand wihtout further further assumptions as this might contraindicate it. Then you must have actual definition & local dependencies ready which needs to be migrated.

- Also another important factor is Go(lang) supports high volume throughput with reverse model working. So control of negotiation of control flow is bit tricky. You better revise your Logical control flows befor proceeding  Huge scalable venture R/W ops. Then plan of your actionable move towards: caching strategy, cdn adapter, server instances, upstream/downststream end-points(in/out), system api-calls throttling likewise mitigations if you're relying on it . 
- Try to find any precedence to maximise the moving journey. Avoid unnecessary GC-pauses with carefully organised payload unlike C free active pointers of use outside the stack created. 
Well done!

For godoc decoration follows Here:

And simple BN Zero implementation which was equivalently shared same understanding technically and by spreading more awareness how Go lang use pointers where unlike in C to references integer value generator's iterator.next() pointer in bit stream manipulation widely simplified if BIGNUM instance actively mutate. Thats again function signature consiquence as behaviour changes State to State.

Always if find DOCS helpful and focus on the basic fundamentals comes with it.
