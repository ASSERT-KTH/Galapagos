In Go, there is no best direct equivalent for the original function because the standard library doesn't contain built-in functions similar to krb5 and there is no equivalent nature of assertions in Go, as there are in C. Still, we can derive a semi comparable one in terms of error checking and printing an error message.

It is important to note that Go requires important logic to decide your actions when encountering an error rather than using something like an ‘assert’ in C. Import, package, or third-party protocols analogous to `krb5` must be applied for, so they are conventionally placed for formatting. We manifest a common error code checking function.

go 
package main 

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func check(code int) {
	var (
		errmsg string
	)
	if code != 0 {
		// Ask some way to retrieve krb5-friendly error remember the contexts and errField respectively.
		errmsg = getErrorMessage(code)
		// A rough equivalent of fprintfstderr
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%s\n", errmsg)  
		// Speculation: Needed only if error message acquisition process allocated some resources
		freeErrorMessage(errmsg) 
	}

	// An alternative to supposedly terminate program like the 'assert' does.
	if code != 0 {
		panic("Unsuccessful run")
	}
}
