The following solution assumes the existence of actual context and error handling functions in the application.

Replace `krb5_get_error_message` and `krb5_free_error_message` with equivalent hypothetical Go functions, `GetKrb5ErrorMessage(ctx, code)` and `FreeKrb5ErrorMessage(ctx, errmsg)`. 

The exact replacement for `krb5_get_error_message` and `krb5_free_error_message` would depend upon existing code and solutions. Unfortunately, my capacity as an AI does not include knowledge about complex specific application states.

go
import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

func Check(code int) {
	var errmsg string

	if code != 0 {
		errmsg = GetKrb5ErrorMessage(ctx, code)
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%s\n", errmsg)
		FreeKrb5ErrorMessage(ctx, errmsg)
	}

	if code != 0 {
		log.Fatalln("assertion failed")
	}
}


I added an import for the `fmt` and `log` packages for logging error messages to STDERR and terminating the program if the assertion fails respectively. Also note that assert code check feature has been replaced with an if statement and a program termination log message as Go doesn't have built-in assert like C. If assert like panics are specifically needed 'github.com/stretchr/testify/assert' package's assert functions can be used.
