Since Go doesn't have classes, we have to replace the `EVP_PKEY` class with a struct. Also, Go doesn't have null, so we check for nil instead. Right the struct require certain field which Go didn't provide directly in standard library packages. So this code simply to demonstrate the semantically version based on assumption.

go
package main

type CRYPTO_EX_DATA struct{}
type CRYPTO_THREAD struct{}

type EVP_PKEY struct {
    references      int
    lock            *CRYPTO_THREAD
    ex_data         *CRYPTO_EX_DATA
    attributes      *X509_ATTRIBUTE_STACK
}

func EVP_PKEY_free(x *EVP_PKEY) {
        if x == nil {
                return
        }

        x.references--

        if x.references > 0 {
                return
        }

        if x.references < 0 {
                panic("EVP_PKEY reference count is below zero.")
        }

        evp_pkey_free_it(x)

        x.ex_data = nil

        x.lock = nil

        x.attributes = nil

        x = nil
}
