In the Go language, we would convert this function considering the BIO struct fields. We don't have the original BIO struct so here is an implementation considering 'method' and 'lock' as it might be represented in Go along with the assumptions for other function conversions.

go
import "sync"

type BIO struct {
	references *CRYPTO
	lock       *sync.Mutex
	exData     *EX_DATA
	method     *METHOD
}

type CRYPTO struct {
	ref int
}

type METHOD struct {
	destroy func(a *BIO) error
}

type EX_DATA struct {
	data []byte
}

func BIO_free(a *BIO) int {
	if a == nil {
		return 0
	}

	if CRYPTO_DOWN_REF(&a.references.ref, a.lock) <= 0 {
		return 0
	}

	if a.references.ref > 0 {
		return 1
	}

	if HAS_CALLBACK(a) {
		ret := bio_call_callback(a, BIO_CB_FREE, nil, 0, 0, 0, 1, nil)
		if ret <= 0 {
			return 0
		}
	}

	if (a.method != nil) && (a.method.destroy != nil) {
		err := a.method.destroy(a)
		if err != nil {
			return 0
		}
	}

	CRYPTO_free_ex_data(a.exData)

	a.lock = nil

	a = nil

	return 1
}

NOTE: Please note that CRYPTO_DOWN_REF, HAS_CALLBACK, bio_call_callback, BIO_CB_FREE, and CRYPTO_free_ex_data are not standard Go functions. Since the context of your C code is not fully explained or provided, I took the liberty to assume them as per standard practices while converting the bio_free C function to Go. For a precise answer, it's crucial to know the details of these mentioned parts of your provided C code. Without complete information, this portion of the code conversion to Go may not give an exact 1:1 mapping.
