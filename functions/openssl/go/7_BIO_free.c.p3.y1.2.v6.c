Because the Go language does not support generic types (at least until Go 2 comes out) or include the equivalent of `C` 's pointer to the starting address (`BIO *a` for example) there isn't a direct equivalent of `BIO` as it exists in C. However, for the sake of your reference, you can see that I have defined `BIO` struct which assumes what meant to be standard based on OpenSSL definition, for cryptography. Moreover, note encryption algorithms library as well locks/synchronization mechanisms are completely different topic and is not converted here from language to language.
go
type BIO struct {
    references int
    lock       sync.Mutex
    callBack   func(int, interface{}, int, int, int64, int64) int
    method     MethodType
    exData     interface{}
}

type MethodType struct {
    destroy func(*BIO)
}

func BIO_free(a *BIO) int {
    if a == nil {
        return 0
    }

    ret := CRYPTO_DOWN_REF(&a.references, &ret, &a.lock)
    if ret <= 0 {
        return 0
    }

    REF_PRINT_COUNT("BIO", a)
    if ret > 0 {
        return 1
    }

    assertRefIsnt(ret < 0)

    if a.callBack != nil {
        ret := a.callBack(BIO_CB_FREE, nil, 0, 0, 0, 1)
        if ret <= 0 {
            return 0
        }
    }

    if a.method != nil && a.method.destroy != nil {
        a.method.destroy(a)
    }

    CRYPTO_free_ex_data(CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_BIO, a, &a.exData)

    // Note: Go's garbage collector handles memory deallocation

    return 1
}
