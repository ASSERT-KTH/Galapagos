The C directive CRYPTO_DOWN_REF, locks the provided BIO and decrements its reference count, so it can not be directly mapped to Go. Direct memory management is not straight forward in Go of this function as Go handles memory management for the programmer unlike C. Due to this restrictions, direct equivalent functionality is not technically feasible. However I tried the simplify the code to make it meaningful for Golang including making reference count decrement, checking nil references which might be semantics in question but directly corresponding code can information can be achieved through Golang's profiling tool PPROF. After profile, memory usage is something automatically managed by Go garbage collector. Still here is a basic implementation in Go language. Please check further how to simulate memory management in Go for this version:

GO
package main

import (
	"sync"
	// OpenSSL Go packages., adjust the 
	// import links according to your package manager
	"crypto"
	// Needs go routines to decrease 
	// the reference count
)

type bioMethod interface {
    Destroy(a *bio) 
}

type bio struct {
	references int
	lock       *sync.Mutex
	method     bioMethod
	callback   func() bool
}

func hasCallBack(a *bio) bool {
    // Modify "hasCallback" suitably as specific implementation was hidden in C
	return a.callback != nil
}

func (a *bio) callCallBack() int {
	if hasCallBack(a) && a.callback() {
		return 1
	}
	return 0
}

func bioFree(a *bio) int {

	if a == nil {
		return 0
	}

	a.lock.Lock()
	defer a.lock.Unlock()
	a.references--

	if a.references > 0 {
		return 1
	}

	if a.callCallBack() <= 0 {
		return 0
	}

	if a.method != nil {
		a.method.Destroy(a)
	}

	/* assuming that both can be not nil at the same time */
	if a == nil || a.method == nil {
		panic("a or a.method is not expected to be nil")
	}

	a = nil // simulates OPENSSL_free(a)

	return 1
}
