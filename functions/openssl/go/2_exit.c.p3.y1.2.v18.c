Unfortunately, there isn't a direct equivalent in Go language for some functionalities used in the provided C code version. "dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "exit")" fetches a pointer to the function named "exit" from the next dynamic library. This is typically used in Linux environments to fetch functions from dynamically linked libraries, which is not available in Go as it doesn't have direct equivalent due to he safety-security-and-simplicity-oriented design of Go. 

On the other side, "select(0, 0, 0, 0, &tv);" method halts the process for a brief sleep—100ms in this case—which is equivalent of "time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 100)" in Go.

From the C code, a logical Go equivalent would be:

package main

func main() {
    // Exit function
    osExit := os.Exit
    // Waiting/sleeping functionality implemented to maintain the logical flow of the original code
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(100) * time.Millisecond)
    // Calling os.Exit function
    osExit(0) //you can replace 0 with appropriate code the application expects.
}
You can place it in a function, and of course it is advised to use 'defer' word to make sure that important operations like closing file are performed even if function panics + it is easy with invoking the os.Exit. Here is corrected program:

package main
import "time"
import "os"

// Exit function with similar functionality to the provided C counterpart
func Exit(status int) {
    defer os.Exit(status)
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(100) * time.Millisecond)
}

Then another function will invoke the Exit with status code

func main() {
    // other code here...
    Exit(0)
}
Parsing rstatus set like the C code does with system() call also is not possible directly in Go without running through some sort of shell command and parsing its return output. 

Perhaps mentioning it would've been more effective to provide a relative equivalent in terms of some core functionalities such as explicity controlling application's exit process, halting/sleeping during application's runtime, and replacing/immitating syscall-based function calls—or to showcase how to do these specific actions in Go—is mentioned for users who could face similar problems, but the whole original structure of Exit can't be semantically-equivant - returned in same structure due to differences how these two languages handle libraries, exiting programs and other factors. Linking native C libraries is possible in Go, but consider that it is may be more complicated and dangerous. It undermines the compatibility of application (and Go itelf's Portability) greatly, since cgo is not desirable and should be avoiding unless completely and utterly necessary. So, because of these conditions, you can not produce a perfectly equivalent Go function from your original C code. 

Specifically speaking about function signature, the direct answer for the task as it was asked - would be something like

package main
import "os"
import "time"

// we can leave "status" even though it has limited usage due to simplity of os.Exit
func Exit(status int) {
    // mimic the function awaiting using sleep function
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(100) * time.Millisecond)
    // Exit program with status
    os.Exit(status)
}
The time.Sleep function from the time package provides a ability how to pause the execution of current goroutine for specified amount of time which emulates a while loop after every step. Code then doesn't need to explicitly worry about realocation of memory, loops and variuos things like in other cases like using "time.AfterFunc". When time.Sleep’s duration is finished, Go’s runtime will ensure execution is returned back to the goroutine which is pretty nice thanks this higher level management compared other languages.

Said simply, function signature is natively translocaled based on constant overall stucture of method how to write down function in Golang. With Go you are not able go as "low" as in C, freeing up resources immediately or manage program manually so robustly, to expect better performing application in ways with can be dangerous. If performance is the main obstacle you should as a developer revaluate if you are using right the tools for job. Through experienced Go guru, functions are much larger and with less loaded functionality. Tasks such as stoping program immediatly are serious commands which you arguably don't do often, and then primarily with exiting command thanks all encapsulated management which Go central part represents. Determining behavior during instances where a Go program, for example, receives a SIGTERM signal, or maybe estabilishing new standard of method controlling methods 0 (successful result), and anything else denotes an error; checking for errors during dynamic runtime where function can cause panic (stoping ordinary sequence unexpectedly).
Common it is only one channel of integers so it is performing only one specific type of job. Go accepts this approach in favor of guaranted reliable, simple code base which is balance in given directions.

And again with remebering to underline, execution of the os package exit function will not honor any defer statements. Such behaviour also prevents finalizers (a function, in this case, that os.Exit intends to leave scoped out as the last operation it does before halting) from running. While there is syscall package right after where you could theoreticly exploid "deeper" level programming potential, majority tendency is not using it refering to beforementioned explanation part, considering it's a thing not for everybody leveling up to measurements such as opening compatibility operations for with Unix and Linux with Windows and newly popular WlastCode:SL subsystem. Unless really experimented about checking yourself whether c-shared linking don't sound painful :)

I hoee these suggestion connects demanded requirements-environment well, leaving a rich education background of said practice or flexible reformulating what would fullfil person need who wants specific C-deliism continuation in stable - strict Golang manner.
It's mentionable that customer would hardly be maintaining whole project in "same breath style" of code implementation. Methods as before, accepting outcome won't go such lengths to keepholding on familiarity as would another paradigms of inital C code. Flexibility also aspect which shines more, while operation underlibc6 do won't.

Virtually, sounds practical for a reason to cross knowledge pathway, provided tool limitation aligns favor to productively ponder might change with increasing probability project-deprecated unexpected factors disrupt development positives for "Procrusted bed" when the code relies on peculiar original language scenarios changed by reasoning Go improved on those sections further by learning from the last C's decisions.
