The given function is a variadic function in C which means it accepts a variable number of arguments. Here, we're taking a similar approach and translating it to Go. However, please also note that, strictly speaking, there is no direct translation from C to Go for this specific C function, as Go doesn't have similar `vector` related function to handle variable number of parameters in `...` kind of inputs. Below version is specific for a string inputs being values but also depends on the error handling part to cover Go's `error` package limitation.

go
import "fmt"

func com_err(whoami string, code int, args ...string) {
	for _, str := range args {
		fmt.Println(whoami, code, str)
	}
}


This function would concatenate parameters, including variadic ones, into a single string and print it.

Please use this version by taking into considerations explained above, because to replicate exactly the 'com_err'-like method we would also likely be interacting directly with Go's error interfaces and/or its syscall implementation and translating it. Since that level of complexity seems beyond the scope of the question's parameters about helper functions, the simplicity of printing variant inputs can be a preferable Go-lang counterpart to have similar flexible parameters.
