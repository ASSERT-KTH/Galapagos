As Go does not directly support object-oriented programming, it's not possible or appropriate to directly translate the given C code (which includes specific C structure types and functions) into Go. But here is a simple Go version that resembles the structure and logic stages of the function:

go
import "errors"

type BIGNUM struct {
    StaticData bool
    Malloced   bool
}

func BN_free(a *BIGNUM) error {

    if a == nil {
        return nil
    }
    if !a.StaticData {
        a = nil
    }
    if a.Malloced {
        a = nil
    }
    return nil
}


This is a very simplified transformation. Depending on how `BIGNUM` is implemented in your Go program and the context of the full program, you may need to change this struct, and to implement more complex memory management and error checking functions.
