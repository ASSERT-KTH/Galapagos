Due to the difference in system architectures between C and Go, generating a function that behaves exactly like the original C function is complex. However, I can provide a simplified version for this function as Go programming has a garbage collector and doesn't require explicit memory release.

But the custom structs, CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_BIO and BIO method's destroy for example, are not represented in this translation. This version in GO is a more conceptual conversion of the above C code. Furthermore, libraries functions such as CRYPTO_DOWN_REF, OPENSSL_free, CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free, and CRYPTO_free_ex_data also had to be done away as they serve exact C language specific purposes.

So basically, I cannot provide the full C function's equivalent version in Go language that represents all the exact steps like the original function in C code. Still, here is a simplified function.

go

type BIO struct {
   References int
   Lock       *sync.Mutex
   Method     *Method
   ExData     []EX_DATA
}

type Method struct {
    Destroy func() bool
}

type EX_DATA struct { }

func BIO_Free(a *BIO) int {

     var ret int

     if a == nil {
         return 0
     }

     a.Lock.Lock()
     defer a.Lock.Unlock()

     a.References -= 1
     ret = a.References

     if ret > 0 {
        return 1 
     }

     if (a.Method != nil) && (a.Method.Destroy != nil) && (!a.Method.Destroy()){
         return 0 
     }

     a.ExData = a.ExData[:0] 

     a = nil 

     return 1 
}


Note that this function in Go doesn't behave exactly the same way like the one written in C, as Go handles memory management differently. However, elements being taken care by those functions CRYPTO_DOWN_REF, REF_ASSERT_ISNT, REF_PRINT_COUNT etc. should be handled by the developer as per their requirements.
