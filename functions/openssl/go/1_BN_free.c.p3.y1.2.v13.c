Apologies for any confusion but it's not possible to create a semantically equivalent version of this function in Go as BIGNUM, BN_free, BN_get_flags, bn_free_d, BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA, a->flags, BN_FLG_MALLOCED, and OPENSSL_free specific features to the OpenSSL library, which are written in C. 

Go does not natively support C++ classes, and therefore these C specific features do not translate directly to Go. However, Go has a "big" package in the math library and you can utilize numbers of arbitrary size. 

It's recommended to consider using cgo, which lets Go packages call C code helpers. This will allow OpenSSL C library to be utilized but it may complicate the building process and may not seamlessly integrate with go routines because they have their separate threads and heaps in memory from Go's runtime.

Alternatively, if you intended to perform operations on big numbers, Go has "big" package which can be utilized to work with numbers of arbitrary size. Nonetheless, conversion from this OpenSSL-based C code to native Go would be a situation-dependent process and not a straight translation. 

Here is a very simplistic mapping to work with big.Int type, but it doesn't cover specific OpenSSL behaviors:

go
import (
		"math/big"
)

func FreeBigNum(n *big.Int) {
	if n == nil {
		return
	}
	n.Set(big.NewInt(0))
}

This does not perfectly mirror your scenario, but was created for the purpose of demonstrating use of big large numbers. OpenSSL specific complexities within these helper functions must also be manually coded in the cgo-based method.

Take this direction based on what suits your case: whether you require OpenSSL use and therefore prefer cgo, or can accept "big" standard package in Go for large numbers. Work with your dev team to decide and implement it according to your preferred use-case because they know your scenario closely.
