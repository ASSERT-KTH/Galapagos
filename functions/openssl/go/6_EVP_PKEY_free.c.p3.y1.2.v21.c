The code you posted is highly dependent on OpenSSL library that cannot be directly translated to Golang `crypto` package as it provides higher-level abstractions over cryptography functionalities compared to OpenSSL. Some parts of the snippet you posted such as EVP_PKEY, CRYPTO_DOWN_REF(), and evp_pkey_free_it() aren't directly supported in Golang. Therefore, a direct semantic equivalent cannot be created without alternative logic or third-party cryptography libraries for Go.

That being said, it's possible to develop function designs for dealing with similar features in Go.

Let's take for example if you're using third-party library `crypto/tls`:

golang
import "crypto/tls"

func FreeEVP_PKEY(x *tls.PrivateKey) {
    if x == nil {
        return
    }

    // There is no direct equivalent for decreasing key references in "crypto/tls", logic may be updated depending on how keys are stored and serviced in your app

    // Assume there is a function to Check Key Lifetime/Existence
    if !PrivateKeyCheck(x) {
        return
    }

    // Here, you would call your own function to deallocate your PrivateKey
    DeallocatePrivateKey(x)

    // Clear the remaining reference
    x = nil
}


The core thing in OpenSSL's `EVP_PKEY_free` function is deleting the key, memory deallocation for which manual intervention is rarely required in Golang due to Garbage Collector managing the memory. Therefore, cleanup of allocations by setting to `nil` is typically what you can do in Go. Clearing the remaining references eliminates the possibilities of them being used after freeing.

Kindly note that "EVP_PKEY_free" knows much deeper about the internals of `EVP_PKEY` structure and how it operates. Using `crypto/tls` is just a surface-level approach. The above function absolutely doesn't accomplish the same as the original `EVP_PKEY_free` and presents just a simple surface alternative in Go. More accurate equivalent depends on the specifics of the application that uses it. More low level manipulation is not typically done directly in Go. For that ctype-like framework or direct interaction with C via CGO would be necessary â€“ Go inherently favors simplicity, overall system stability and ease of use over deep level interference capabilities.
