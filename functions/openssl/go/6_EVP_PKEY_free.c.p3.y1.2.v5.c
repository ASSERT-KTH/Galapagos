Unfortunately, it is not possible exactly copy this function directly into Go. This is because the C code utilizes features that are simply not available or work differently in Golang. For instance, Go does not have built-in support for reference counter nor does it support explicit memory management as all of it is controlled by Go's garbage collector.

This code appears to be part of the OpenSSL library, a language-specific application. It would not be an exact semantically equivalent, but perhaps a function in Go cryptography library would serve a similar purpose as this original as Go provides TLS and Crypto libraries for certificate management and cryptographic operations.

That being said, here are some other possible adjustments to consider:

• Can't manage the memory as in C using methods like CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free, so no manual de-allocation possible in Go.
• Error checking would require examination of errors returned by functions rather than using assert macros like in C.
• Open language-specific interfaces would have to be employed to handle data like CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_EVP_PKEY, as Go lacks explicit pointer arithmetic and type casting.

Therefore, achieving a direct, semantic equivalent function in Go while maintain the original function signature may not be possible. However, if OpenSSL’s specific functions(free cryptographic key object, managing cryptographic operations data, etc.) are what you're looking to emulate in Go, there are already many libraries that provide an abstraction over those. For usage, refer to https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/ packages which are the official go cryptography libraries.

Always be sure to review carefully and do extensive testing while working in cryptography and ensure using libraries that are mature and effectively reviewed.
