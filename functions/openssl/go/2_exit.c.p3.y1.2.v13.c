It's not possible to properly convert this function to Go due to several limitations of Go standard library.

This C function does a couple of things: 

1. It sets a delay with `struct timeval` and `select empty set`.

2. It looks up the "real" `exit` function symbol with `dlsym` (`RTLD_NEXT, "exit"`), which is dependent on dynamic linking, not available in pure Go without linking to C or using third party library `cgo`.

3. It calls the real exit function with status code passed.

In Go, we can't directly access symbols from the dynamic linker (such as exit(0)) like in C.

Moreover, using `time.Sleep` in Go is not valid as well, because it does not holding the program execution like `select()`, and Go will immediately close all goroutines including current goroutines (not like main thread in C).

Conclusion: Because of Go's security enforcement and limitations to low-level operations, the strict equivalent for this function does not exist without relying third-party packages. GO is designed to be a simple and secure language over broader functionality observed in languages like C. Language features, like interacting with dynamic linker symbols and micro-precision sleeping are intentionally restricted in Go for the elegance and safety of its design.
