It's not entirely clear for the conversion as C has different core libraries than go. Plus some C functions will not have directly equivalent functions in Go as they are written in different style. Plus the function mechanism and signature of these two languages are different as well.

But here is my best attempt to inform how an equivalent function may look based upon the available understanding.

Assuming BIO as We define our BIO equivalent as a structure:

Go
package main

import (
    "sync"
)

type BIO struct {
    references int
    lock       *sync.Mutex
    method     *BIO_METHOD
    ex_data    *CRYPTO_EX_DATA // Assuming CRYPTO_EX_DATA exists and has a proper structure
}

type BIO_CRYPT_REF struct {
    downRef func(*int, *int, *sync.Mutex) int
}

type BIO_METHOD struct {
    destroyer func(*BIO)
}

func (a *BIO) free() bool {
    ret := 0

    if a == nil {
        return false
    }

    if downRef(&a.references, &ret, a.lock) <= 0 {
        return false
    }

    if ret > 0 {
        return true
    }

    if a.method != nil && a.method.destroyer != nil {
        a.method.destroyer(a)
    }

    //freeExData()
    //a.ex_data = nil

    a.lock = nil

    a = nil

    return true
}

Some parts are assuming the availability of functional equivalent "FREE" style Functions in Go used in the main method, as the act of directly freeing marked memory, as in the original C function `CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free`, `OPENSSL_free`, or `CRYPTO_free_ex_data`, isn't idiomatic or readily available in Go, due to the manner how garbage collections works here. Moreover certain OpenSSL libraries functions need alternatives or their GO equivalent to use.

Please adjust the assumptions and their respective libraries or method according to the project requirements and availability.
