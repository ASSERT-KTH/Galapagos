It is challenging to develop an exact equivalent Go version of this `C` code because some of the used functions and types, like `BIGNUM`, `BN_CTX`, `BN_POOL_get()`, `CTXDBG()`, `BN_zero()`, `ERR_raise()`, etc., are quite specific to OpenSSL (a specific library in C for cryptographic operations). If a direct correlation within Go's standard library or a precisely similar library has not been established, the code cannot be converted straightforwardly or meaningfully.

Nonetheless, the closest possibility possible can be achieved to represent a corresponding high-level structure utilizing Go's big package built-in library and utilizing an error handling model.

Here is a likely Go alternative:

go
type BNCTX struct {
	errStack   bool
	tooMany    bool
	pool       *big.Int
	flags      int64
	used       int64
}

func BNCTXGet(ctx *BNCTX) (*big.Int, error) {
	var ret *big.Int

	if ctx.errStack || ctx.tooMany {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("Error Stack: %v, Too Many Instances: %v", ctx.errStack, ctx.tooMany)
	}

	ret = new(big.Int)

	// just an example how the assignment from the pool might be handled, because in Go we do not need pointer to retrieve value from big.Int types
	if ctx.pool == nil || ctx.pool.Cmp(big.NewInt(0)) != 0 {
		ctx.tooMany = true;
		return nil, errors.New("Too many temporary variables")
	}

	*ret = *ret.Sub(ctx.pool, big.NewInt(1))

	ret = new(big.Int)
	ctx.used++

	return ret, nil
}


This implementation is merely informative on handling fields/features about the context. It tries to mirror fields values and operations. You might need to adjust or turn it according to your specific use case or application particularly with regards to library usage.
