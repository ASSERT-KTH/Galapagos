Due to the nature of some function calls in the original C code and expectations, a direct transcription (which can compile and run without proceeding to errors) to Go is inherently challenging. Nevertheless, the main semantics of the above C code can be instrumental in writing its equivalent Go function.

A simple pseudocode version resembling core analogy with above C function is composed.
However, this should not be seen as legitimate working Go code but rather as conceptual pseudocode for reference only. A true implementation would require thorough understanding of the cryptography library been seen for usage and their implementation to high-level languages like Go.

go
import "sync"

type EVP_PKEY struct {
    references  int
    lock        *sync.Mutex
    ex_data     interface{}
    attributes  []X509_ATTRIBUTE
}

func EVP_PKEY_free(x *EVP_PKEY) {
    if x == nil {
        return
    }

    withLock(x.lock, func() { x.references -= 1 []; return x.references > 0 }) 
    if x.references > 0 {
        return
    }
    if x.references < 0 {
        panic("reference count < 0")
    }

    evpKeyFree(x)

    clearExData(x)
    releaseLock(x.lock)

    clearAttributes(x.attributes)
    opensslFree(x)
}

func withLock(lock *sync.Mutex, fn func() bool) {
    lock.Lock()
    defer lock.Unlock()
    if !fn() {
        panic("crypto down ref failed")
    }
}

func evpKeyFree(key *EVP_PKEY) {
    // TODO: invoke appropriate Free function in actual code, this is placeholder
    // placeholder() 
}

func clearExData(x *EVP_PKEY) {
    // TODO: Call relevant function to free 'ex-data', this is placeholder
}

func releaseLock(lock *sync.Mutex){
    // TODO: Implement CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free equivalent in Go, handling mutex locks
}

func clearAttributes(attrs []X509_ATTRIBUTE){
    // TODO: Write call to critical logic for freeing attributes data 'x.attributes'
}

func opensslFree(x *EVP_PKEY){
    // TODO: Implement OPENSSL_free equivalent in Go
}


Please ensure to replace 'TODO' sections with feasible system calls based on particular needs. Evaluate prudently with additional constructs required in many parts of the program apart from placeholders that are stated which suits your needs. Hence one should not expect this code to run correctly with these section untouched or the standard packages. This pseudo-code concentrates to pinpoint the whole claim to frame the C equivalent in Go. Compiler complaints are expected whether run off the bat if placed into any .go source file.
