Go does not have a directly similar package to OpenSSL, the functionality which is reflected on the example. However, if C's BIGNUM related features are needed and implemented on one's custom type like "customBIGNUM" or if crypto/big package of Go servers the purpose of OpenSSL's BIGNUM, here is the example script by considering "crypto/big"'s Int as a functionally similar type to BIGNUM.

Go
import "math/big"

func BN_free(a *big.Int) {
    if a == nil {
        return
    }
    // a == the expected condition; Open for modification
    // As per the original function: if (!BN_get_flags(a, BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA))

    // Here, "bn_free_d" logic is absent
    // As per the original function: if (a->flags & BN_FLG_MALLOCED)

    // Instead of "OPENSSL_free(a);" 
    a = new(big.Int) // Resetting A
}


**Please Note: Since Go doesn't support freeing memory, unlike C which requires developers to manage memory access manually by making use of built-in functions to free the occupied memory space, given Go script does merely set the a to zero (considering math/big) by assigning a new(big.Int) to it.** Hence, there isn't a perfect 1-to-1Â mapping to the Go equivaluation from OpenSSL's memory related functions. It is due to the distinction in the memory management of two different languages that support the garbage-collection feature of Go.
