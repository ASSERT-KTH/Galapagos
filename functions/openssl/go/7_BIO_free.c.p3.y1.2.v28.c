It's important to note that this translation cannot be accurate without appropriately defined data types, references handling and error checking procedures mirror those offered by OpenSSL's bio library in C. golang's crypto libraries are not low-level mirror images of OpenSSL and working with operations like explicit ref-counting, low-level memory delocation might even contradict the safety measures implemented by Go’s design team like managed memory and type safety. This translation serves as a spirit of the conversion. Not considering the difficulty about implementing low-level actions like `CRYPTO_DOWN_REF`, this function does anyway exceptionally cloud with technical debt.

Please, find pseudo code to represent equivalent function in Golang down below:

golang

import "crypto"

func BIOFree(a *crypto.BIO) int {
    var ret int

    // Check for null value
    if a == nil {
        return 0
    }

    // CRYPTO_DOWN_REF is not accessible in Golang's 
    // crypto libraries as they are entirely seal off from direct access.
    // It is automaticaly deallocated after serving its purpose, using GC

    REF_PRINT_COUNT("BIO", a) // It can't actually be implemented as Go gides i.e(intellisense) for variable prints
    if ret > 0 {
        return 1
    }

    // REF_ASSERT_ISNT would be using panic in Golang but it contradicts its paradigm

    if a.callbackPresent {
        callStatus := a.CallBack(BIO_CB_FREE, nil, 0, 0, 0L, 1L, nil)
        if callStatus <= 0 {
            return 0
        }
    }

    if a.method != nil {
        if a.method.destroy != nil {
            a.method.destroy(a)
        }
    }
    
    // CRYPTO_free_ex_data() function would not have a direct equivalent again 
    // because go is a garbage collected language

    // CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free equivalent function would not be directly accesible in Golang

    // OPENSSL_free() equivalent function would
    // not be directly accesible in golang.

    return 1
}

As for assistance, a meaningful equivalent might be made by using the github.com/spacemonkeygo/openssl package, however this package is formally no longer maintained which is reasonably denoted to say that such low-level control like OpenSSL’s bio, in golang, counteracts the efficacy convention of golang itself i.e strict type safety, avoidance referencing to null or uninitialized values, runtime guard for array out of bound...
OpenSSL's BIO library resides neighboring the intersection of Input/Output (IO), Protocol Parsing and even Thread-Safety, any changes would need intensive examination, a software wrapper like OpenSSL’s bio library, into the golang convey inclination to be improper per se.”
