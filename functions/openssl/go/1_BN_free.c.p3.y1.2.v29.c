Translating this C code into a Go code would turn out unconventional since Go doesn't support certain C programming constructs such as manual memory management (freeing memory). 

Additionally, OpenSSL's big number arithmetic related processes like BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA and bn_free_d do not have direct equivalents in Go's math/big package.

In Go, garbage collection handles memory allocation and deallocation dynamically. Therefore, you do not manually free allocated memory like in C, C++, etc.

Thus, any equivalent would primarily focus on mimicking processes of value nullification and checking validation but will skip memory deallocation:

go
import (
   "math/big"
   // other necessary packages.
)

type BIGNUM struct {
   bigInt *big.Int
   flags  int
}

const (
   BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA = // Define appropriately based on your OpenSSL big number logic.
   BN_FLG_MALLOCED    = // Define appropriately based on your OpenSSL big number logic.
)


func BN_free(a *BIGNUM) {
    if a == nil {
        return
    }
    if !BN_get_flags(a, BN_FLG_STATIC_DATA) {
       bn_free_d(a)
    }
    if a.flags & BN_FLG_MALLOCED != 0 {
       a = nil  // Based on your OpenSSL requirements.
    }
}

// bn_free_d and BN_get_flags should be defined separately based on necessary OpenSSL BN_free execution equivalents. 
 

Remember, in Go, the new/memory allocation objects become immediately accessible for garbage collection as soon as they become unreachable, regardless of retaining their reference location in memory. So, you don't need an atomic memory operation as the OpenSSL_free() alternative.
