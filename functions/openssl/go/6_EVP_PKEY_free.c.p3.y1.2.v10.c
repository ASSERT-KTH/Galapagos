Since Go does not support methods with the function signature of EVP_PKEY_free, it's impossible to directly convert the code. However, we can at least write a Go function that mirrors the constructs and control flow.

Go has garbage collection and doesn't need explicit memory management, so the use of `CRYPTO_free_ex_data`, `CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free`, and `OPENSSL_free`, has been omitted. Replace them with necessary clean-up operation in case you need to free some eventual C memory manually in cgo pointer management.

You must use cgo to incorporate these C constructs, as Go itself does not support pointers in the same way.

Also, FIPS_MODULE clause was removed since preprocessor directives (#ifdefs, #ifndef, etc.) don't exist in Go.

Here is an illustration on how a corresponding solution in Go (with cgo) could look like:

go
/*
#cgo LDFLAGS: -lcrypto
#include <openssl/evp.h>

void (*evp_pkey_free_it)(EVP_PKEY*);
void (*crypto_down_ref)(void*, int*, void*);
void (*ref_print_count)(const char*, const void*);
void (*ref_assert_isnt)(int);
*/
import "C"

import (
    "unsafe"
)

func FreePKey(x *C.EVP_PKEY) {
    var i int

    if x == nil {
        return
    }

    C.crypto_down_ref(unsafe.Pointer(&x.references), &i, unsafe.Pointer(x.lock))
    C.ref_print_count(C.CString("EVP_PKEY"), unsafe.Pointer(x))
    if i > 0 {
        return
    }
    C.ref_assert_isnt(i < 0)
    
    C.evp_pkey_free_it(x)
}

Instead of converting `EXDES` they could be cleaned referencing to the question notes, and removing `x.attributes` would depend on how they are retrived / accessed in Go, therefore no operations were performed over those.

`*C.EVP_PKEY` implies that the `PKEY` struct has a representation in Go, thus the translated function could be altered to handle your Go implementation of the struct accordingly.
