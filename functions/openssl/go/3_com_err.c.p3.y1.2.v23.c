In Go, variadic functions are formatted differently, and printing or logging errors frequently involves the "fmt" or "log" package. Since Go sacrifices some robustness in flexibility in exchange for the simplicity, therefore we may have to alter the signature slightly, but can maintain the overall external behavior and input/output semantics. A conversion might look like this where three dots (...) in function signature denotes that function can have any number of arguments from third one.

Also, in Go there is no direct equivalence of errcode_t from C but it can be take as plain integer or another error (Refer the Go code below, error have been used) for instance.

golang
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

func com_err(whoami string, code error, format string, a ...interface{}){
	// First print the identifier
	fmt.Println(whoami)
	
	// Then print the code
	fmt.Println(code)
	
	// Then use the format string for remaining arguments
	// The 'a' package encapsulates the remaining args
	fmt.Printf(format, a...)
	
	// \n to terminal next said inputs at new line (as per fmt.Println works in go vs fmt.Print)
	fmt.Println("\n")
}


These squares dots '...' tell the function to accept a variable number of arguments for that parameter. In other words, "fmt" could be supplied zero arguments or more. Println function prints its arguments with Spaces in between and \n at end.

Since Python does not support ... (variadic arguments) in the function like Go with characters as variable arguments we get error since Go considers a string as an array of multiple strings and Python itself considers them as a string of multiple characters therefore error arises.So in this python takes String and list as different entities and fills the ... with the value of array that was passed in else it gives an error string is not an array of multiple elements as below.

So for the setup fmt.Printf(format, a...) only prints the lines it want it to print and not echoes it output. Therefore used fmt.Println(fmt. to comvert Printf content to string and print using the Println().
