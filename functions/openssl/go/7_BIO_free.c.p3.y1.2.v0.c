As per provded by prompt below is thee "rough" golang equivalent for provide C Code- 

go
func BIO_free(a *BIO) int {
     var ret int
    
    if a == nil {
        return 0
    }

    if CRYPTO_DOWN_REF(&a.references, &ret, a.lock) <= 0 {
        return 0
    }

    REF_PRINT_COUNT("BIO", a)
    if ret > 0 {
        return 1
    }
    REF_ASSERT_ISNT(ret < 0)

    if (a.method) != nil && (a.method.destroy) != nil {
        a.method.destroy(a)
    }

    CRYPTO_free_ex_data(CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_BIO, a, &a.ex_data)

    CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free(a.lock)

    OPENSSL_free(a)

    return 1
}

Few pointers about such continous language translation:

1. In C if a pointer point to NULL is nil is c, in go a nil pointer is also nil.
2. Parrens are not needed for if in Go.
3. Go does not need type before the variable.
4. Go does not require semicolons at the end of the line.

However, it's worth mentioning that translating low-level memory management from one language to another is risky because each language handles it differently. If improperly stated, it may lead to unexpected outcomes. Thus the deep understanding of system architecture and relative language differences in handling such scenarios is important.
