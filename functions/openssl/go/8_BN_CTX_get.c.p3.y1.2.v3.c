As Go does not have classes and instance methods in the same way as C, the conversion requires significant changes. Also, error handling practices will be followed in Go that are significant departures from those of the original function. This Go analogue below emulates the precise module state updates and condition verification checks with these constraints:

Go
func BN_CTX_get(ctx *BN_CTX) *BIGNUM {
	if ctx.err_stack || ctx.too_many {
		return nil
	}
	bignumval, err := BN_POOL_get(ctx.pool, ctx.flags)
	if err != nil {
		ctx.too_many = true
		return nil
	}
	BN_zero(bignumval)
	bignumval.flags &= (^BN_FLG_CONSTTIME)
	ctx.used++
	return bignumval
}


Notably the Go error technique doesnâ€™t avoid cluttering in the same way as the original function mandates. Also, it is assumed that `BN_POOL_get`, `BN_zero` and error definition will exist elsewhere in the codebase. Depending on their definitions, changes may be needed to perfectly mirror the original C function. Feel free to add any neccessary error handling methods. It is completely ok to do so since Go primarily relies on checking error type and value of the returned error whereas in C `ERR_raise` used to capture and display an 'error signal'.
