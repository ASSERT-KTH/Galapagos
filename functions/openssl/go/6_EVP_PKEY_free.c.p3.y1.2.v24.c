In Go, we don't typically deal with pointers ourselves or do explicit memory management, as we would in C. Also, there are quite a few operations in this C code that have no exact correspondence in Go due to the differences in language paradigms, like `#ifndef`, reference manipulation and thread safety. 

Nevertheless, supposing `EVP_PKEY` might be a  structure and defining it according to common conventions in Go, one simplified and partially satisfactory assertion might be:

Go
type EVP_PKEY struct {
	References  int
	Lock        sync.Mutex
	ExData      interface{}
	Attributes  []X509_ATTRIBUTE
}

type X509_ATTRIBUTE struct {
}

func X509_ATTRIBUTE_free(*X509_ATTRIBUTE) {}

func EVP_PKEY_free(x *EVP_PKEY) {

	if x == nil {
		return
	}

	x.Lock.Lock()

	x.References--
	i := x.References

	if i > 0 {
		x.Lock.Unlock()
		return
	}

	// Clear ExData
	x.ExData = nil
	
	// Clear and free the attributes
	for _, attribute := range x.Attributes {
		X509_ATTRIBUTE_free(&attribute)
	}
	x.Attributes = nil

	x.Lock.Unlock()
}


In this rendition, we're utilizing mutex directly for thread safe operations which is natively supplied by Go's `sync` package. It's a best guess assertion because C code utilizes unique OpenSSL actions, mainly cryptographic and thread handling procedures, and roles given to language by language needs and paradigms are very much distinct.
