Here is a program transformation that adds logic to track if there was a memory allocation failure at some point during the function execution. This slightly varies the behavior by maintaining additional context about the operation, while keeping the overall functionality the same. 


BIGNUM *BN_CTX_get(BN_CTX *ctx) {
  // flag to track if there had been a memory allocation error
  int memoryFailure = 0;

  // Once any operation has failed, they all do.
  if (ctx->error) {
    if (ctx->defer_error) {
      OPENSSL_PUT_ERROR(BN, BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES);
      ctx->defer_error = 0;
    }
    return NULL;
  }

  if (ctx->bignums == NULL) {
    ctx->bignums = sk_BIGNUM_new_null();
    if (ctx->bignums == NULL) {
      OPENSSL_PUT_ERROR(BN, ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE);
      ctx->error = 1;
      memoryFailure = 1;
      return NULL;
    }
  }

  if (ctx->used == sk_BIGNUM_num(ctx->bignums)) {
    BIGNUM *bn = BN_new();
    if (bn == NULL || !sk_BIGNUM_push(ctx->bignums, bn)) {
      OPENSSL_PUT_ERROR(BN, BN_R_TOO_MANY_TEMPORARY_VARIABLES);
      BN_free(bn);
      ctx->error = 1;
      memoryFailure = 1;
      return NULL;
    }
  }

  if (memoryFailure) {
    // Log somewhere that there was a memory allocation error.
    // Logic traces that there was a memory failure during this execution.
  }

  BIGNUM *ret = sk_BIGNUM_value(ctx->bignums, ctx->used);
  BN_zero(ret);
  // This is bounded by |sk_BIGNUM_num|, so it cannot overflow.
  ctx->used++;
  return ret;
}
