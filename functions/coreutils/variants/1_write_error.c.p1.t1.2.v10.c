Sure, here's a refactored version that still performs the same operations as the original. 

The execution order is a little changed but it doesn't affect the functionality.


void write_error(void) {
    int saved_errno = errno;

    /* Clear errors and ensure stdout is ready before potential error inducement */
    clearerr(stdout);

    fflush(stdout);  

    /* Use state from before cleaning possible errors */
    error(EXIT_FAILURE, saved_errno, _("write error"));
}
