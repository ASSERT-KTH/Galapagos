The provided C function `compare` is making comparisons based on different types of that it has. While maintaining original functionality, a simple way to make a variant is by rearranging the conditions used to converge the value of `diff`. 

int compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
    int diff;
    size_t alen, blen;

    /* First if no key is specified fallback to default comparison. */
    alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;
    if(alen == 0 || blen == 0)
    {
        diff = (alen == 0) ? - NONZERO (blen) : 1;
    }
    else if (keylist)    /* Then try to compare on the specified keys (if any). */
    {
        diff = keycompare (a, b);
        if (diff)
            return diff;
    }
    else if (hard_LC_COLLATE)   /* check for hard Locale collate.*/
    {
        diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
    }
    else
    {
        diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));
        if (!diff)
            diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
    }

    return diff_reversed(diff, reverse);
} 

As I undeerstand the requirement specified "changes the Behavior of the original function while maintaining its original functionality" which I see only by rearrange conditions in structure with same functionality and code coverage.
