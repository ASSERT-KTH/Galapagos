Modification 1: Replacing `printf` with `snprintf` and then outputting the buffer to `stdout`
(Assuming we're not considering the size of the buffer, for simplicity sake. In practical scenario buffer size should be calculated dynamically)

char buffer[1024]; // assuming 1024 is large enough. Or else dynamically calculate the buffer size

emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
  ... // same as original

  snprintf(buffer, 1024, _("\n%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL);
  fputs(buffer, stdout);

  ... // same as original

  snprintf(buffer, 1024, _("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"),
          PACKAGE_URL, url_program);
  fputs(buffer, stdout);

  snprintf(buffer, 1024,_("or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, node == program ? " invocation" : "");
  fputs(buffer, stdout);
}


Modification 2: Changing the order of `printf` statements while preserving the behavior with temporary variables (`string_to_print`):


emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
  ... // same as original

  char const *string_to_print1, *string_to_print2, *string_to_print3;

  string_to_print1 = _("\n%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL;
  string_to_print2 = _("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"), PACKAGE_URL, url_program;
  string_to_print3 = _("or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, node == program ? " invocation" : "";
  
  printf (string_to_print3);
  printf (string_to_print2);
  printf (string_to_print1);

  ... // same as original
}

Please note that these changes are for the sake of transformations, they do not improve performance or style of the original code. Also, both of these modified implementations imply memory safety risk and usage constraint. Please use according to resources and scenario. Even when considering the transformation, one should think if any modification would still adhere to the desired functionality from the implementer and should impact its orientation.
