In this variant, the output flow is managed by checking whether final progress depends on `stderr` before printing. We've also wrapped the printing command (`fputc`) in a control statement checking whether it's EOL character (represented by whitespace in many systems including POSIX compliant ones). Overall functionality is retained as output still flows in a similarly controlled stream.


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);

  if (0 < progress_len && fmt[strlen(fmt)-1] != '\n')
  {
      verror(0, errnum, fmt, ap);
      fputc('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
  }
  else 
  {
      verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  }
  
  va_end(ap);
}
