Note: This alternate version opens and closes `stderr` multiple times, treating it as a different file each time, and it immediately flushes any output to the redirected `stderr`. This might be less efficient, but ensures writing to `stderr` is accurate and immediate. Please keep in mind to test if `fdopen` and `dup` functions return non-null pointers before you use `fw` (file-pointer); these calls can fail under low-memory or other error conditions. Always make sure that normal error checking and release resource when finished.

So, I kept the functionality the same by diagnosing the error message to the `stderr` in your specified way whilst utilising your same function signature.
Initially, if `progress_len > 0` the new line character is written correspondingly in stderr indicating some kind of progression is there.

Afterward diagnosing error is going on where the variable-length argument is under consideration. These actions are wrapped up by following `C standard` carefully and buffer strategy(which is more technical depth needs buut maintaining its original functionality.
