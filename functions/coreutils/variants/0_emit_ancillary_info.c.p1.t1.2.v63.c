It is not clear what kind of behaviour modification is needed for the given function. There may be several ways to modify behavior while retaining original functionality. This may depend on the specific needs, like handling additional scenarios, improving code performance, etc. 

To present one available option, an additional string interpolation method could be added at the end inside an "if statement" depending on a certain condition represented by a "turn_on_special_behaviour" bool-like variable. Of course, wondering where this "turn_on_special_behaviour" variable should take its value would defy request's boundaries (Do not create auxiliary nor helper functions), but it could for instance depend on an external constant or be fetched from a preprocess computed value, which are inherently out of the scope of this function. This external factor may depend on something like user preferences or a specific software version complying. Let's suppose that it should print some extra debugging information (original behaviour + dbg feels like one minor thing adding some debugging stdout info). Here is how one might implement it:


emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
  struct infomap { char const *program; char const *node; } const infomap[] = {
    { "[", "test invocation" },
    { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
    { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { nullptr, nullptr }
  };

  char const *node = program;
  struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;

  while (map_prog->program && ! STREQ (program, map_prog->program))
    map_prog++;

  if (map_prog->node)
    node = map_prog->node;

  printf (_("\n%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL);

  /* Don't output this redundant message for English locales.
     Note we still output for 'C' so that it gets included in the man page.*/
  char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);
  if (lc_messages && STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_"))
    {
      /* TRANSLATORS: Replace LANG_CODE in this URL with your language code
         <https://translationproject.org/team/LANG_CODE.html> to form one of
         the URLs at https://translationproject.org/team/.  Otherwise, replace
         the entire URL with your translation team's email address.  */
      fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
               "<https://translationproject.org/team/>\n"), stdout);
    }
  char const *url_program = STREQ (program, "[") ? "test" : program;
  printf (_("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"),
          PACKAGE_URL, url_program);
  printf (_("or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, node == program ? " invocation" : "");

  // A possible variable from some place not further explained
  if (turn_on_special_behaviour)
  {
    printf ("Debug information: program - %s, node - %s\n", url_program, node);
  }
}


Code presumes there's a if (turn_on_special_behaviour) or something equivalent going on. We presumed as an example they are using a boolean flag from the outside to conditionally turn on some specific behavior when documenting/inspecting the run in stdout. It's but an example. Different needs will demand different outcomes. Clarifying the expected behavior change can lead to better-suited and probably smarter solutions.
