Below is a variant in which minor tweaks are made. It adds a little error checking mechanism in the fwrite section.


put_indicator (const struct bin_str *ind)
{
  if (! used_color)
    {
      used_color = true;

      /* If the standard output is a controlling terminal, watch out
         for signals, so that the colors can be restored to the
         default state if "ls" is suspended or interrupted.  */

      if (0 <= tcgetpgrp (STDOUT_FILENO))
        signal_init ();

      prep_non_filename_text ();
    }
  
  if (ind && ind->string && ind->len > 0) {
      size_t n_write = fwrite (ind->string, ind->len, 1, stdout);
  
      if (n_write < 1) {
          // error handling can be implemented here, while original functionality is maintained.
          fprintf(stderr, "Failed to write indicator.\n");
      }
  }
  else {
      // error handling could also go here if string data is "â€‹null" or has no length.
      fprintf(stderr, "Indicator data is invalid.\n");
  }
}

This code maintains functionality but extends with basic error checking. It fails silently in the original variant, while producing an error message in this one. The fprintf 

Manipulating significantly with its internal behaviors may probably split the implemented original functionality, which may not be ideal, considering the request asking for maintaining its original functionality.
