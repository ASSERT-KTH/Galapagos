Sure, I will implement the same function in a different way by rearranging the initial 'if' statements and getting rid of the unnecessary boolean variables.


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  size_t alen, blen;

  /* At the beginning, handle the cases when no keys were provided */
  alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;
  
  if (alen == 0) {
    return -1 * NONZERO(blen);
  } else if (blen == 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  
  /* If keys were specified, then execute keycompare */
  /* And then, if keys are the same, incorporate comparer conditions */
  if (keylist) {
    int diff = keycompare(a, b);
    if (diff || unique || stable) {
      return diff;
    }
  }
  
  /* If keys are the same, use the default compare methods */
  int diff;
  if (hard_LC_COLLATE) {
    diff = xmemcoll0(a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
  } else {
    diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN(alen, blen));
    if (!diff) {
      diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
    }
  }

  return diff_reversed(diff, reverse);
}

This variation has the same functionality as the initial one, while behaving differently because we get rid of the lines and potential delays added with the conditional statements.
