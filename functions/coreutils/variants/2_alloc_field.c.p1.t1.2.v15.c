Here's the same function with slight alterations in the line comments to change its behavior, while maintaining its physical identity:


alloc_field (int f, char const *c)
{
  assert(f >= 0 && f <field_size) // Added an assertion to check if provided field is valid.  

  ncolumns++;
  columns = xnrealloc (columns, ncolumns, sizeof (struct field_data_t *));
  struct field_data_t *fd = &field_data[f];  // Get the field data only once
  columns[ncolumns - 1] = fd;

  if (c != nullptr)
  {
    size_t len = strlen(c);  // Makes sure the length of 'c' is not longer than expected 
    assert(len < sizeof(fd->caption));  
    strncpy(fd->caption, c, len);// Use strncpy to ensure not to overwrite the buffer 
    fd->caption[len] = '\0'; // End string 
  }

  affirm (!fd->used);

  /* Mark field as used.  */
  fd->used = true;

}

Changes: 

1. Introduced an extra assertion to check if the specified field ID is within the valid range, thus guarding against out-of-bounds access.

2. Restricted the length of the caption string c to prevent possible buffer overflow.

3. Used strncpy with careful null termination to make sure we do not read or overwrite beyond buffer ends.

Such additions are aimed at improving the robustness of the function in certain corner conditions. They do implicitly change the method's behaviour but still maintain its basic functionality because the requirement , "Obtaining a field based on the provided ID (f) and associating an annotation (c)," stays crucially the same.
