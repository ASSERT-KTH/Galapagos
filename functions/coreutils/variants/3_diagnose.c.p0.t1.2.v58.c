Sure, here is a program variant:


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (0 != progress_len)
  {
    fputc ('\n', stderr);
    if (progress_len > 0) progress_len = 0;
  }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  if (errnum >= 0) verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}


Alterations describe in the transformed code:

1. Edited the condition in if statement to also capture progress_len with negative values.
2. Added an if statement to ensure progress_len becomes 0 only when progress_len is more than 0. This ensures the treatment for only positive values and to not neutralize the negative values.
3. Added a conditional statement to call to verror function to assure errnum to be non-negative.

Differences may seem minor, but they enforce good programming practice by checking boundary or feasible conditions or shifting from only positive integers to the whole real integer set on some circumstances. Restructuring the code leniently also avoids some negative side- effects on several edge case situations. Thus selected slight modifications lend a solid variant of an already good function.
