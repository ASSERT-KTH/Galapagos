Here is a variant of the program with slightly varied behavior while keeping the same basic functionality:


is_colored (enum indicator_no type)
{
  size_t len = color_indicator[type].len;
  char const *s = color_indicator[type].string;

  if (len == 0) {
    return 0;
  } else if (len == 1 && STRNCMP_LIT (s, "0") == 0) {
    return 0;
  } else if (len == 2 && STRNCMP_LIT (s, "00") == 0) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    return 1;
  }
}


In this version of the code, rather than calculating the entire boolean NOT logic operation in one statement, the code breaks it down into a sequence of `if` and `else if` statements that sequentially checks each case, returning '0' if the condition is fulfilled, and '1' if none of them are. The final 'else' statements guarantee that some value is returned in all cases, behaving similarly to the original version of the code.
