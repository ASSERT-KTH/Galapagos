Below is a diagnostic function that embellishes the original function slightly by adding some optional output. 


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  // Add an optional debug flag to conditionally print output
  int debug = 0;

  if (debug)
  {
    if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      fprintf(stderr,"diagnoze entered with errnum = %d, format = %s\n", errnum, fmt);
    }
    else
    {
      fprintf(stderr,"diagnoze entered with errnum = %d\n", errnum);
    }
  }

  if (0 < progress_len)
  {
    fputc ('\n', stderr);
    progress_len = 0;
  }
  
  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}  
 
Please note that if debug mode is set (`debug!=0`), the diagnostics function will print additional outputs to stderr. This can be useful during the software development process, though it should probably be deactivated (`debug=0`) in the production version of the software.

This new function maintains the original function's functionality as the insertion of the 'debug' conditional doesn't alter the base logic of the function - it merely supplements it with extra functionality should the 'debug' flag ever be toggled on from its default value of '0'. It is noteworthy that to manipulate the debug status, one may need to adjust the value inside the function itself. Without changing that situation, an improved design might take advantage of an external value for the debug value or perhaps a more elaborate compilation process that provides multi-option functionality to the software.
