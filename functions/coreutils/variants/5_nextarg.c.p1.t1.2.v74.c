It appears you have provided a partial C incomplete code: there are undeclared variables, for instance, "args" mentioned but not declared or defined and undeclared function called "STREQ". Nevertheless, let's assume that the flow of the function is clear, i.e., continuing till string end pointer or till we find the target string. Here is how a more streamlined and relatively error-free variant may be implemented


bool nextarg (char const *str, char const **args)            
{                                                          
    if (str == nullptr || *args == nullptr)
        return false;
    
    *args = strstr(*args, str);
    
    if(*args)
    {
      *args += strlen(str);
      return true;
    }

    return false;
}


Please note: in this revision, we presupposed the intention behind the unknown function STREQ to be 'compare string' as that's what the function seemed geared to provide with the available code. 

`strstr` gives us the first occurrence of 'str' in '*args'. When it returns nullptr which signifies no match found, we return false. If it does points to some areas i.e., match found, we advance the pointer '*args' till the end, it is supposed that '*args' will be used in a successive call for the function for further match finding after current match. 

Since a change is made to function signature to pass `args` by reference, Use `&args` (casting `args` to pointer to pointer to pass by reference) When calling `nextarg` so continue functioning in successive call.
