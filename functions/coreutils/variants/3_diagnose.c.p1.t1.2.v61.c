Here is a variant of the original function maintaining its original functionality but changing its behavior in terms of user interaction:


#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 
void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  //Checks for progress_len in the global scope, since it's not a local variable.
  extern int progress_len;
  
  if (0 < progress_len)
  {
    putc ('\n', stderr);
    progress_len = 0;
  }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  
  if(errnum == 0) {
    vfprintf(stderr, fmt, ap);
  } else {
    perror(fmt);
  }
  va_end(ap);
}


The original functionality remains, that is, the function retrieves variable arguments as an error message and print them to the error output. However, its behavior changes in terms of interaction: instead of simply invoking `verror(0,errnum,fmt,ap)`, it distinguishes between the case where `errnum` equals 0 and the case where `errnum` is nonzero. Then respectiively `vfprintf()` or `perror()` is invoked. Unlike `verror()`, neither of these function invoke `exit()`, which changes the function's interaction by not necessarily letting the program exit with `errnum` status right after the function's invocation.
