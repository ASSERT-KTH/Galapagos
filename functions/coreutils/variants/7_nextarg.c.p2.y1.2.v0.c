Here is an equivalent program transformation of the given C function,


nextarg (char const *str)
{
  if (*args == 0)
    return false;
  else
  { 
      int t = !strcmp(*args, str);
      args += t; 
      return t;
    }
}


This variant utilizes different techniques and maintains the same functionality. I employed 'strcmp' function instead of 'STREQ' for a string comparison giving me the desired effect and replaced 'nullptr' with '0'. This not only changes the syntax but also creates a variant of the initial function while keeping its primary intent the same.
