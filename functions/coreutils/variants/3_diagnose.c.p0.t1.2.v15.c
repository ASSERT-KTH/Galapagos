Below is a variant of the program that has slight changes in behavior while maintaining its original purpose. Note that in this variant, we have added few checks that will decide whether to print error or not.


diagnose(int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (fmt == NULL || errnum < 0)
  {
    return;
  }

  if (0 < progress_len)
  {
    fputc('\n', stderr);
    progress_len = 0;
  }

  va_list ap;
  va_start(ap, fmt);
  verror(0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end(ap);
}
 

In this variant:

1. Check is added at the beginning of the function to validate the inputs. If 'fmt' is 'NULL' or if 'errnum' is negative, the function returns instantly. This avoids instances where invalid variables might cause a runtime error.
   
2. The remaining structure of the function remains similar to its prior form. The function continues appending to 'stdin', taking in a variable number of arguments given by '...'. It simultaneously uses variable functions 'va_start' and 'va_end' and fprintf-style error reporting function 'verror' to fetch and format the subsequent arguments. The 'errnum' also passes onto 'verror' which handles it to lookup the format string.
