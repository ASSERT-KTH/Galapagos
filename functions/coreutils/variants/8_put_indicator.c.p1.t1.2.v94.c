In the provided improved function, a static boolean variable color_initialized is used instead of the used_color global variable to mark optional code block has been executed at least once. The static variable keeps its value between different calls to the function, making it behave like used_color in the original code. However, unlike a global variable which is accessible by any part of the program, a static local variable limits its scope to only within the function where it is declared, providing a safer and cleaner approach. Any bugs due to unforeseen side effects modifying the global variable value outside this function could be avoided, increasing maintainability and reliability of the code.
