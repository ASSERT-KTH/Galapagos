A potential transformation could be as follows, removing some comments and altering error handling:


xwrite_stdout (char const *buffer, size_t n_bytes)
{
  size_t wrote_bytes = 0;  
  if (n_bytes > 0)
  {
    wrote_bytes = fwrite (buffer, 1, n_bytes, stdout);
    if (wrote_bytes < n_bytes) {
      error (EXIT_FAILURE, errno, "error writing standard output");
    }
  }
}


This code still primarily serves the same purpose as the original code: it attempts to write data to the standard output. However, it has refined the error messaging aspect, directly outputting a hard-coded message instead of leveraging a localization tool (for example, gettext as indicated by _(' ')). Also instead of calling clearerr, this code directly shows an error through the error function call.
