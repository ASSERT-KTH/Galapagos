The modified function could be as follows:


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <errno.h>

void write_error(void)
{
    int errno_snapshot = errno; // Variables name changed

    // Error handling code wrapped inside an if statement
    if(errno_snapshot != 0)
    {
        fflush(stdout); 
        clearerr(stdout);
        error(EXIT_FAILURE, errno_snapshot, "write error");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("No error to report.\n");
    }
}

It maintains the original functionality of checking the error status and if it's not zero, it will flush the stdout, clear any error statuses with it, and then print an "exit failure" error message.

However, it changes the behavior by directly stepping over these steps when there are no errors reported and would print "No errors to report." in this case. This minor behavior changes in the function provide better error handling causing less ambiguity when stderr has been redirected to stdout.

In this variant, I have avoided displaying the errors when errno shows no errors, thus providing a cleaner output when running this function. This might be beneficial in certain situations, for example, testing, where stderr has been redirected to stdout.

NOTE: This variant relies on the global `errno` variable. In practice, other parts of the program may have made other system calls that non-deterministically cause other errors (even before the `fflush` or `clearerr` calls). Meaning depending upon the other parts of how the program is structured the behavior alterations may not be justified completely.
