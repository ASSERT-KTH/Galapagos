Below is a varient that maintains the original functionality while changing the behavior:


alloc_field (int f, char const *c)
{
  /* Checking if the field has been used earlier */
  if (field_data[f].used)
    return;  

  columns = xnrealloc (columns, ncolumns + 1, sizeof (struct field_data_t *));
  columns[ncolumns] = &field_data[f];
  
  /* Check for nullptr */
  if (c){
    columns[ncolumns]->caption = c;
  }

  ncolumns++;

  /* Mark field as used.  */
  field_data[f].used = true;
}

This varient changes the behavior by first verifying if the mentioned field has already been used before proceeding. This avoids multiple use of the same field preventing any redundancies. Additionally, we first realloc the memory and then increment the `ncolumns`. This might help in avoiding potential off-by-one errors. Additionally, while checking for `nullptr`, we used a direct if condition for readability. The rest of the functionality of allocation remains equal with no significant behavior change other than safety and slight optimization checks introduced. The overall outcome remains the same.
