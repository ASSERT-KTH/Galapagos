Your requirement suggests that the function has to retain its original functionality. Usually, altering the function's behavior needs adding, removing, or modifying some functionality. Since the constraints of your requirement don't allow that, a possibility is to arrange the code differently without changing what the code does fundamentally. Here's an example:



diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);

  if (0 < progress_len)
  {
    fputc ('\n', stderr);
    progress_len = 0;
  }
   
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}


Please note that while the rewritten function has a different structure and may have differences in output timing, it could technically maintain the same functionality as the original depending on the underlying functionality of 'verror' and 'fputc'.
_Some context is missing as to what 'progress_len', 'verror',  'va_start' etc. functions do in this code making it a bit challenging to provide a useful revised function whilst retaining the same behavior._ A tailored response would be provided if additional information is given.
