Here is an alternative implementation of the function:


alloc_field (int f, char const *c)
{
  struct field_data_t **temp = xnrealloc (columns, ncolumns+1, sizeof (struct field_data_t *));
  if (temp != nullptr)
  {
    columns = temp;
    ncolumns++;
    columns[ncolumns - 1] = &field_data[f];

    if (!field_data[f].used)
    {
      if (c != nullptr)
        columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = c;

      /* Mark field as used.  */
      field_data[f].used = true;
    }
  }
}


This version performs essentially the same task, but checks if the memory reallocation was actually successful before assigning the new chunk of memory to the `columns` variable and incrementing the ` ncolumns`, thereby maintaining the program integrity in the event of memory allocation failures.
Also added an additional check to set caption only if the field has not been used before.
