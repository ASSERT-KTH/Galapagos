Below we have slightly rearranged the function with changes in branches conditions still keeping the same logic for data comparison:


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t alen, blen;

  /* We give priority to the length comparison first if no keys are provided */
  if (!keylist)
    {
      alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;
      if (alen == 0) diff = - NONZERO (blen);
      else if (blen == 0) diff = 1;
      else if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
        {
          diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
        }
      else
        {
          diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));
          if (!diff)
              diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
        }
      return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
    }
  /* Then we try keys (if any only if previous condition didn't meet) */
  else
    {
      diff = keycompare (a, b);
      if (diff || unique || stable)
        return diff;
    }
  return 0;
}


Please note changing code order may optimise the running time of this function based on the number of comparisons which need to be done before finding that two objects are not equal. So, efficiency may vary widely, depending on the types of data the function deals with in the regular application. 

Keep in mind that reordering such key functions may not bring benefits for cases this function expected to get from being arranged in original way with key-based logic is prioritised to be attempted first.

Also it is changed behavior since NOW length comparison tried first unlike previous version. So objects which has keys won't go to `keycompare(a,b)` trail first. They stick onto check by length-related conditions branch.
