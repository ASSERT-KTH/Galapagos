The program below redoes the logic of 'diagnose' by writing to a buffer and then writing that to stderr providing the same functionality as the original, while changing its behavior.


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void diagnose(int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
    char buffer[1024];

    if (0 < progress_len)
    {
        buffer[0] = '\n';
        buffer[1] = '\0';
        progress_len = 0;
    }
    else 
    {
        buffer[0] = '\0';
    }

    va_list ap;
    va_start(ap, fmt);
    vsnprintf(buffer + strlen(buffer), sizeof(buffer) - strlen(buffer), fmt, ap);
    va_end(ap);

    if(errnum != 0)
    {
        strncat(buffer, ": ", sizeof(buffer) - strlen(buffer));
        strncat(buffer, strerror(errnum), sizeof(buffer) - strlen(buffer));
    }

    fputs(buffer, stderr);
}


NOTE: The progress_len was not defined in the original snippet. It made an assumption that it's accessible and mutable from diagnose function. And, buffer size was limited to 1024 which can be altered depending on system and efficiency requirements. Important, this function variation might limit the size of original error string due to buffer size.
Finally, keep in mind to include proper error handling depending on the project's existing patterns and standards.
