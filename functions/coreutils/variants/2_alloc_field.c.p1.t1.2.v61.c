You can change the behavior of the function by adding error handling scopes, rearranging of the code for added efficiency, or adding debugging information for enhancement of quality. 

Here is a variant which incorporates error handling:


alloc_field(int f, char const *c)
{
  /* Safety check if provided field index is valid. This line is added for error handling */
  if (f < 0 || f >= FIELD_DATA_SIZE) 
  {
    printf("Invalid field index.\n");
    return;
  }
  
  /* Check if the field is already used. This rearranges the methods from the original to be more efficient. */
  if (field_data[f].used) 
  {
    printf("Field data is already in use.\n");
    return;
  }

  /* Then start the real Allocations actions */
  ncolumns++;
  columns = xnrealloc(columns, ncolumns, sizeof(struct field_data_t *));
  	
  /*  Checks if xnrealloc succeeded in allocating memory, also not present in original function this adds to quality */
  if(!columns) 
  {
    printf("Failed to allocate memory.\n");
    return;
  }
  
  columns[ncolumns - 1] = &field_data[f];

  if (c != nullptr) 
  {
    columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = c;
  }
     
  /* Mark field as used. Not present in original function but good for readability*/
  field_data[f].used = true;
}

In addition, the changes maintain the signature of the function just as the original functionality, efficiency and error handling.
