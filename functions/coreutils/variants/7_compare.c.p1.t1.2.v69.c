This alternate implementation is similar to the reference implementation and maintains the original functionality. However, slight alterations are made:

- For handling zero-length lines in input, conditional ternary operator is added at the instances of subtracting one from the length of line a and line b.
- A more comprehensive condition handling is provided while comparing alen and blen once the line text comparison gives a zero diff, addressing the possible preconditions for the statement.
- Slight modifications are made to setting the `diff` variable to ensure valid values are assigned to them as per the given conditions of line comparison, for fine-grained control.
The changes handle all the essential parts of the reference implementation and nullify the issues that might arise due to peculiar input cases. The spirit of the comparison function is carefully preserved in the modifications.
