Here is the transformed function with a slight variation:

compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff = 0; 
  size_t alen, blen;

  /* First try to compare on the specified keys (if any).
     The only two cases with no key at all are unadorned sort,
     and unadorned sort -r. */
  if (keylist)
    {
      diff = keycompare (a, b); 
      if (unique || stable || diff != 0)
        return diff;
    }

  /* If the keys all compare equal (without any input keys)
     fall through to the default comparison analyization. */
  alen = a->length - 1; 
  blen = b->length - 1;

  if (!alen)
    diff = - NONZERO (blen);
  else if (!blen)
    diff = 1;
  else if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
    {
      /* xmemcoll0 will not write '\0' after the
         passed in buffer specs, which elicit performance improvements for short lines. */
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, 1+alen, b->text, 1+blen);
    }
  else
    {
      size_t min_len = (alen < blen ? alen : blen);
      diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, min_len);
      if (diff == 0)  
        diff = (alen > blen) ? 1 : ((alen < blen) ? -1 : 0);
    }

  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}
