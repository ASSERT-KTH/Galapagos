A program variant that is more clear can have an early return when `alen` or `blen` is zero and avoid nested condition in the end to increase readability. The following is a possible optimized version with minor modifications.


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t alen, blen;
  
  if (keylist)
  {
    diff = keycompare (a,b);
    if (diff || unique || stable)
      return diff;
  }

  alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;
  
  if (alen == 0 && blen != 0)
      return -1;
  if (blen == 0 && alen != 0)
      return 1;
  
  if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
  {
    diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
  }
  else
  {
     diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));
 
     if (!diff)
     {
       if (alen > blen)
         diff = 1;
       else if (alen < blen)
         diff = -1;
       else
         diff = 0;
     }
  }
  
  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}

This updated 'compare' function is clearer, which means it would be easier for other programmers to understand. All functionality of the initial function is preserved. This code avoids complexity whenever `alen` or `blen` is zero by returning `-1` or `1` right away. Last part of this function comes with improved code readability, specifically comparison block, which replaces mathematical trick (subtracting boolean values) with more explicit evaluations.
