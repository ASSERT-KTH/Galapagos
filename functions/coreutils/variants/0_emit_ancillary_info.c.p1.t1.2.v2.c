You can add different conditions inside the program, or modify the message somehow. Please note that the code would compile correctly only if the expanded marcos and definitions of functions used in this function definition are properly included in the program. The following change diverts the program to output a different report URL when the default locale isn't 'English'


emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
  struct infomap { char const *program; char const *node; } const infomap[] = {
    { "[", "test invocation" },
    { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
    { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { nullptr, nullptr }
  };

  char const *node = program;
  struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;

  while (map_prog->program && ! STREQ (program, map_prog->program))
    map_prog++;

  if (map_prog->node)
    node = map_prog->node;

  printf (_("\n%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL);

  char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);
  if (lc_messages && STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_"))
    {
      fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
               "<https://www.differenttranslationbugs.org/>\n"), stdout);
    }
  char const *url_program = STREQ (program, "[") ? "test" : program;
  printf (_("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"),
          PACKAGE_URL, url_program);
  printf (_("or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, node == program ? " invocation" : "");
}

In this version of the function, if the locale is not English, the users are suggested to address their report to a fictitious website ("differenttranslationbugs.org") instead of to the original "translationproject.org/team". Modifying program behaviors based on detected locale is a frequent practice in multilingual software systems and it’s one example of designing around varying regional needs or distinctions. Keep in mind that you will have to replace "differenttranslationbugs.org" with a valid report URL as per your project constraints and your organization’s IT policy.
