One possible way to transform this C program is to change the error handling. The original version outright terminates the program if there was an error writing to stdout. We can modify it to simply return an integer value, where any non-zero number represents an error. 


int xwrite_stdout (char const *buffer, size_t n_bytes)
{
  int err = 0;
  if (n_bytes > 0) {
    size_t ret = fwrite(buffer, 1, n_bytes, stdout);
    if (ret < n_bytes) 
    {
      // if fewer bytes than expected were written, it's an error
      clearerr(stdout);
      fprintf(stderr, _("error writing %s\n"), quoteaf("standard output"));
      err = 1;
    }
  } 
  return err;
}


Note: The error message is directed to stderr instead of stdout now. The `_()` and `quoteaf()` functions are still used, assuming they perform localization (i18n) and string formatting (respectively) as they may in some common C programming idioms. This code does maintain its originality of writing n bytes to stdout and communicates any issue/error information back to caller.
