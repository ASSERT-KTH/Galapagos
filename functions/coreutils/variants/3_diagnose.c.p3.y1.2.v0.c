It actually wouldn't be possible to directly convert this C code to Go unchanged. Go has different rules for how variadic function parameters are handled compared to C, and Go doesn't have a compatible equivalent of the va_start, va_end, and verror functions used in this code. So there's not a way to re-write this C function in Go.

It depends on the specific behavior of the verror function on how we can consider changing this code. If verror internally calls fmt.Fprintf, we might represent the equivalent behavior of that specific part of the function with fmt.Fprintf in Go, but only afer considerable changes as Go uses completely different mechanisms (interfaces and method sets) to achieve pseudo-generic varargs functionality whereas C uses standardized macro expansion for va_list. 

Additional concerns are that standard error stream access in Go is different from C and that you would need to import several packages (os, fmt and errors at least) to represent the whole functionality of the C code in Go properly.

Without an accurate information on the behavior of verror function, vague estimation of the equivalent Go code would be:

go
import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func diagnose(errnum int, fmt ...interface{}) {
	if progressLen > 0 {
		// handle progressLen and outputting newline in some way 
                // or omit if not present in requirements. Most likely through a stream
		// with specific stdout stderr redirection or similar.
		progressLen = 0
	}

        // you could also use os.Stderr depending on personal preference/house style.
 	fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, fmt...) 
}


Without more information like the exact requirements for this function and the behavior of external/usual dependencies (especially verror), we can't do more interpretation on that, making any further assistance difficult. Is there any additional background/context you could tell us about?
