Your request seems a bit ambiguous but if you need the function to still handle an error on write operations but possibly act differently, we can include a file or log where the error details will be written to. This will maintain the functionality but add behavior, granted that the error log file path "errorlog.txt" is accessible. Here is a potential variant:


#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>

void write_error (void)
{
  int saved_errno = errno;

  // Open an error log file
  FILE * fp;
  fp = fopen ("errorlog.txt", "a");
  
  if(!fp)
    error (EXIT_FAILURE, saved_errno,_("Failed to open log file"));
    
  fprintf(fp, "An error occurred: %s\n", strerror(saved_errno));
  fflush (fp);
  fclose(fp);

  fflush (stdout);
  clearerr (stdout);
  error (EXIT_FAILURE, saved_errno, _("write error"));
}


In this code, still leaves an error message to STDOUT, tells the system to exit with a failure value, sets the error number to our saved error number, then writes a translated string with our error message ("write error"). But before it also writes the same message to a logfile which could be accessed later. 

Do note that for very safety-critical applications, how you want to handle and signify error conditions needs careful planning to make sure users or downstream applications are correctly alerted about some problem.
