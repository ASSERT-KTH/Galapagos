The C program variant below should change the behaviour of the original function while maintaining its original functionality:


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <error.h>

int progress_len = 0; 

void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 5;
    }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}

In this C program variant, an extra line 'progress_len = 5;' is added whenever 'if (0 < progress_len)' is True. The file and the library inclusion are: '#include <stdio.h>','#include <stdarg.h','#include <error.h>'. The global variable 'progress_len' is initialized with a value of 0. 

This changes the behaviour of the original code but keeps its functional essence intact by taking format string along with optional parameters as input, checks if progress_len is greater than 0, prints new line if it is (unnecessarily here just for demonstration), start variadic parameters, sending those parameters along with error number and the format string to verror to print meaningful error messages understandable by humans and then cleans up the memory occupied by those variadic parameters. It's just resetting the progress_len back to 5 for some different functionality than kept in the original where it was only resetting to 0 if newline is printed.
  
This shows how synthesis can automate variation at the very basic level in C.
