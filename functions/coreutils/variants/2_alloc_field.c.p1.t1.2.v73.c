Here is a variant of the function that maintains its original functionality but contains slightly different behavior. In this variant, instead of changing the caption field in the structure only if the given pointer `c` is not null, it initializes it to an empty string during allocation. This way, the field won't potentially hold an undefined value, and won't crash if it's manipulated further down the line.


void alloc_field (int f, char const *c)
{
  ncolumns++;
  columns = xnrealloc (columns, ncolumns, sizeof (struct field_data_t *));
  columns[ncolumns - 1] = &field_data[f];
  // Initialize caption to an empty string
  columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = "";

  if (c != nullptr)
    columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = c;

  affirm (!field_data[f].used);

  /* Mark field as used.  */
  field_data[f].used = true;
}

The behavior change here lies in the additional line of code that sets the caption of the field in the column to be an empty string initially. This might alleviate bugs depending on how the provided code interacts with the "caption" field before running the check for `c != NULL`. If other parts of the code rely on caption being non-null, this modification is perhaps constructive towards enhancing safety/regulating behaviour.
