In this version, we only perform the initialization routine for the colored output the first time a color is used(Done via color_init static), providing some additional resource saving (such as middleware services calling external level APIs) thereby optimizing the run-time efficiency. Additionally, that might remove possible visual terminal glitches when re-executing handle/restore color-related functionalities.

Moreover, the fwrite function's return check occurred which allows to help discussing error; It yields a non-handle scenario in the case fwrite operation isn't successful.
