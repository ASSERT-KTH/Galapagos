Here is a code variant that maintains the initial function's core functionality while making a few modifications in its behavior.


void diagnose (int errnum, const char *fmt, ...)
{
  if (progress_len > 0)
  {
    fwrite ("\n", 1, 1, stderr);
    progress_len = 0;
  }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  
  if (errnum != 0) 
  { 
      verror(0, errnum, fmt, ap); 
  }
  
  va_end (ap);
}

1. I replaced the `fputc` call with `fwrite`. While `\n` is outputted functionally similar as before, this changes the method by which this is done.
 
2. I modified comparison condition `(0 < progress_len)` to `(progress_len > 0)`. Essentially they're the same, but they represent a slightly different programming preference/style.

3. I added a condition to verify if errnum is different from 0 before calling `verror` function, this does not omit any case if compared to the original program, according to the `verror` documentation (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/error.3.html) passing zero as the errnum does nothing (already handled by verror function).
