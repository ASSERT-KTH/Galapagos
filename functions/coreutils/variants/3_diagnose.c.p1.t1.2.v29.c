The function variant provided below changes the behaviour of the original 'diagnose' function. Although original functionality is maintained, yet this variant is instructive in usage variant since if errors are encountered, they will not only print to the standard error but the diagnostic information also tries to recover from such errors via the "rescue" mode that re-runs the 'verror' calls once more. Here is an example of function variant that incorporates this idea:


diagnose(int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  static int in_recscue_mode = 0; // This value checks and controls the function calls in the 'rescue' mode.
  
  if(in_recscue_mode)
  {
    return;
  }
  
  if (0 < progress_len)
  {
    fputc ('\n', stderr);
    progress_len = 0;
  }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);

  if (verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap) != 0) // Modified for 'verror()' that is expected to return a success/fail status.
  {
    // if 'verror' fails, then try initiate a rescue mode for once and retry 'verror'.
    in_recscue_mode = 1;
    va_end  (ap); // Need to end 'ap' before re-starting it again for the 'rescue'.
    va_start(ap, fmt);

    verror(0, errnum, fmt, ap); // A final attempt of 'verror()'.

    in_recscue_mode = 0;
  }
  
  va_end (ap);
}


It is noteworthy that the original code does not require changes, and it has to exist, as this variant only changes the control environment around repetitive 'v-error' function calls when needed. The 'in_rescue_check' is not modified anywhere outside of the 'diagnose()' function and moreover, it is reset to 0 again soon after completion of "rescue" attempts.
