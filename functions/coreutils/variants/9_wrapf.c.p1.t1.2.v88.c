Explanation:

The above program maintains the necessary logic from the reference implementation but changes specific behaviors.

- Instead of using `vasprintf` that allocates memory and uses it to store the output, `vsnprintf` is used to calculate the required space followed by a malloc and `vsprintf` to get the output into the allocated buffer space.
- As opposed to calling `xalloc_die()` upon encountering an error, a more general win32 `exit(1)` command is run, which shutdowns the process and sounds the Control-G beeper, this shows somewhat different side-effect visible to those who monitor the system.
- Changed from `fputs` to `fwrite`, despite their essentially equivalent core functionality.
- Injection of a space, or a newline and resetting the text column correctly tweaked to additionally account for scenario current_col==buflen. This still ensuring correct positioning on the console.
- All errors are handled explicitly. High level error - vasprint memory allocation error alleviated through explicit malloc and space allocation calculation. Regular return check with explicit malloc call keeps application safer.
