You can't generate meaningful transformations of the given C function without changing its functionality, changing the function's signature, or using helper functions. Variants could only include basic transformations such as changing variable names, re-arranging lines of code within their logical sections, or changing control flow structures without affecting functionality, as long as the variables are function-format specific, not changing the function functionalities and maintaining the orgiginal functions signature. Here are a few examples of these basic transformations:

1. Change of the variable names:

mbsalign (char const *source, char *destination, size_t dest_size,
          size_t *w, mbs_align_t align, int flags)
{
  size_t res = SIZE_MAX;
  size_t s_size = strlen (source) + 1;
  char *new_str = nullptr;
  wchar_t *str_wchar = nullptr;
  char const *str_for_print = source;
  size_t columns = s_size - 1;
  size_t used_bytes = columns;
  size_t space = 0;
  bool conv = false;
  bool wchar_flag = false;
  // Remainder of the function follows...
}
  

2. Minimizing scope of variables:

mbsalign (char const *src, char *dest, size_t dest_size,
          size_t *width, mbs_align_t align, int flags)
{
  size_t ret = SIZE_MAX;
  size_t src_size;
  char *newstr = nullptr;
  wchar_t *str_wc = nullptr;
  // Bottom part of the function...
}
  

3. Re-orders lines of code within their scopes/logical sections:

mbsalign (char const *src, char *dest, size_t dest_size,
          size_t *width, mbs_align_t align, int flags)
{
  wchar_t *str_wc = nullptr;
  char *newstr = nullptr;  
  char const *str_to_print;
  
  size_t ret = SIZE_MAX;
  size_t src_size = strlen (src) + 1;
  size_t n_cols = src_size - 1;
  size_t n_used_bytes = n_cols;
  str_to_print = src;
  
  size_t n_spaces = 0;
  bool conversion = false;
  bool wc_enabled = false;
  
  // Remainder of the function code below...
}
  
Remember any transformations you make should not affect how the function functions and maintain the original function signature.
