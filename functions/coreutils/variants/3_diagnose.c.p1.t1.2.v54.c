Here is a variant of the function that enhances its original functionality. It maintains the function's original functionality by checking the `errnum` for a specific known error code and adding some specific handling for it, while not disrupting how other error numbers are processed.


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  // check for specific error code and handle it differently
  if (errnum == MY_SPECIFIC_ERROR) 
  {
    fputs ("error: specific error occurred!", stderr);
    return;  // return here assuming we don't want to do any additional processing in this case
  }
  
  if (0 < progress_len)
  {
    fputc ('\n', stderr);
    progress_len = 0;
  }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}

Replace `MY_SPECIFIC_ERROR` with an actual error code as necessary. This new version of `diagnose` behaves the exactly like the original version unless the error number passed to it is `MY_SPECIFIC_ERROR`, in which case it does something different - it prints a specific error message and returns immediately. For any other error number, it will behave as it used to.
