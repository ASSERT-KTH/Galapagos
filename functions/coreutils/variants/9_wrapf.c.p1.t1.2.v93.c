While it looks like several changes were made, these generally maintain the original functionality of the first "wrapf()" implementation but slightly changes its behavior, notably:

* It replaced the response to `xalloc_die()` which might have different behavior than `exit(1)`. `exit(1)` halt program execution and raises value `1` to indicate an error has occurred.
   
* The order of conditions after check `if (0 < current_col)` is reversed increasing `current_column++` prior to further checks. This could affect subsequent checks in a multi-threaded environment.
  
* it also checks if output stream writing by `fputs` and freeing memory using `free` is successful this slight change of behavior making sure function executed without issues. exists with an exit code (`exit(1)`) to indicate a problem if outputs have failed. Note that `free (buf) !=0` is not a standard way of checking success of free as conventional free does not return value. This is incorporated just for change behavior possibility however, in general it might not compile.
