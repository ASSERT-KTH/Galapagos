Here's a variation of your function which should retain the same underlying functionality but changes how it interacts. It logs the values to be output by calling `fwrite` function for debugging convenience using printf statement.


void put_indicator (const struct bin_str *ind)
{
  if (used_color != true)
  {
    used_color = true;

    /* If the standard output is a controlling terminal, watch out
       for signals, so that the colors can be restored to the
       default state if "ls" is suspended or interrupted.  */

    if (tcgetpgrp (STDOUT_FILENO) >= 0)
      signal_init ();

    prep_non_filename_text ();
  }

  printf("Debug: string: %s len: %d", ind->string, ind->len);
  fwrite (ind->string, ind->len, 1, stdout);
}

In this variant, we have added a debug print statement inside the function to report the internal values it is operating on. This might be helpful for debugging or logging but should not otherwise practically affect the operation of the function. It is worth keeping in mind that such debug messages might not be desired in a final release though so such modifications should be toggle-able or easily removed. Adding conditional compilation directives or using a more sophisticated logging facility where it's easy to control the output verbosity, might be preferable in a production-grade code.
