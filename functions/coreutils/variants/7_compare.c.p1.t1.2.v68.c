You could achieve the transformation by modifying the way some conditions are checked. Given below is one of several possible solutions: 


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff = 0; 
  size_t alen = a->length - 1; 
  size_t blen = b->length - 1; 

  if (keylist)  // If there is a keylist...
  {
    diff = keycompare (a, b);   // Compare using specific keys 
    
    if(((diff != 0) || unique || stable)) // If diff exists,stable, or unique
      return diff;    
  } 

  if ((alen != 0 && blen != 0) && (!hard_LC_COLLATE))
  {
    diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, (alen < blen) ? alen : blen);
    if (diff)
      return diff_reversed(diff, reverse);
    
    diff = (2 * (alen > blen)) - 1;
  }
  else
  {
    if (!alen)
      diff = -!!blen;
    else if (!blen)
      diff = 1;
    else if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
   } 

  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}


This code does not inherently affect function's functionality since every transformation made condition checking simpler than originally. While changing the order, all inputs would prompt the same result. Maintaining correct order, inputs would walkthrough through less conditions freeing computational resources and performance + conserving their original results. This transformation is also a tradeoff, it provides more simplicity but takes some directness which may make it harder initially to track.
