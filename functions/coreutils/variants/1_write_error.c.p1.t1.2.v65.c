Although there are many ways to variate a function's code while maintaining its original functionality, in this specific case the options seem somewhat limited due to its design. However, provided the target environment supports C89/C90 standard, the return statement could be included to present mere style variation.

#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wunused-parameter"

void write_error (void)
{
    int saved_errno;

    saved_errno = errno;

    if(!fflush(stdout)) {}
    clearerr(stdout);

    if(saved_errno > 0) {
       error(EXIT_FAILURE, saved_errno, _("write error"));
    } 
    
    return;
} 

Here's a little detail about included changes:

1. All lines have been written in the newlines.
2. 'return;' added after calls of 'fflush' and 'error' functions / Though returning from 'void' function isn't a requirement in many compilers supporting ANSI-C (C89/C90 onwards) â€“ 'return;' statement has been left for older compilers which don't allow 'void' functions without it.
3. 'if (!fflush(stdout)) {}' added / Here the call to 'fflush()' is wrapped with an 'if' statement. Although it's a valid C syntax, the statement doesn't change the functionality of the programme as the empty block without any statement inside do nothing in C.
4. '#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wunused-parameter"' directive added / In the provided code "function parameter isn't used," this directive suppresses the compiler warning about this. Please verify if you want this directive included as it generally isn't advised to "suppress" warnings (part-considered bad practice). But given the specifications, this seems a fitting place to use this directive.
