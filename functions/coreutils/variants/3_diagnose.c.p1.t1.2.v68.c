Here is a program variant for your function:


#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...) {
    static int progress_len = 0;
    if (progress_len > 0) {
        fputc('\n', stderr);
        progress_len = 0;
    }

    va_list ap;
    va_start(ap, fmt);
    if(errnum != 0) {
        vfprintf(stderr, fmt, ap);
        fprintf(stderr, ": %s", strerror(errnum));
    } else {
        vfprintf(stderr, fmt, ap);
    }
    va_end(ap);
} 


In the given variant of the function, the progress_len is defined as a static variable inside the function, as it is not given in the function parameters and is not defined outside the function. In the variant, I used existing stdio.h and string.h error handling functions. The primary change in this variant lies in using vfprintf directly to output errors to fprintf. However, the functionality and signature of the original function is retained by keeping the variable argument list handling the same, and by keeping the error handling aspects of the original function(i.e. fputc and stderr). The revised function checks if errnum is zero. If it isn't zero, then it treats it as an error and additionally writes the string representation of the error message to stderror. This variant of function maintains same behavior as the original except it treats errnum strictly based to its value. Otherwise, it mostly follows the same structure as the original function.
