In Go, variadic parameters have a different behavior when compared to C, so it is not possible to make a direct function signature translation and maintain equivalent functionality. In C, arguments can be of any type, while in Go they must all be of the specified type (in this case string). However, let me translate the `diagnose` function as closely as possible in Go using `fmt.Errorf` and `log.Print`:

go
import (
    "log"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

// Initialize the progress_len globally, which is assumed to exist in the C code.
var progress_len = 0

func diagnose(errnum int, fmtStr string, args ...interface{}) {
    if progress_len > 0 {
        fmt.Fprint(os.Stderr, "\n")
        progress_len = 0
    }

    errStr := fmt.Errorf(fmtStr, args...).Error()
    log.Print(errnum, ": ", errStr)
}

It's important to note that it is not literally equivalent due to key differences in how Go and C handle variadic arguments and standard I/O, as well as error handling. Most notably, the `verror` functionality does not exist in Go – which outputs an error message to stderr and, if a non-zero error number is given, outputs strerror or an equivalent error message alongside the user-provided error message – so `log.Print` and `fmt.Errorf` is used instead.
Please adjust according to the conventions and custom functions of your development context as needed.
