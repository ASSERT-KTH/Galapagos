The transformed version of the given function is as shown below:


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  // Slightly varied behavior: Change condition by >= instead of >
  if (progress_len >= 0)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);  
      progress_len = 0;
    }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  fprintf(stderr, "\n");
  va_end (ap);
}


In this variant, we modified the condition to execute the `fputc(...)` and `progress_len = 0;`. This allows running the code block when `progress_len` equals zero as well, which maintains the original function's functionality while varying the behavior. Another transformation was added at the end of `verror (...);`, where we immediately print a newline character to `stderr`. Now, error messages produced by `verror(...);` will standalone on its line of output.
