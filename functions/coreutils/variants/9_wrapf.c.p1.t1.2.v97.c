The provided code is used to print a string message. It seems to have controls to handle the length of the message & ensuring next printf doesn't exceed the max_col character per line limitation. Changed behavior variant could polish disposal of allocated buffer from heap ('buf') change formatting slightly with handling spacing between lines or any other modification not affecting overall functionality.

Changelog:

- The buffer 'buf' would now be released in any situation (helps to avoid memory leakage instances as earlier it depended upon particular conditions). 

- An extra check is added preventing a call to 'fputs' if the 'buflen' is less than zero in order to avoid any likely segment faults.


wrapf (char const *message,...)
{
  va_list args;
  char *buf = NULL;
  int buflen;
  
  va_start (args, message);
  buflen = vasprintf (&buf, message, args);
  va_end (args);

  // Exit in case of a bad formatted 'message'. Free up buffer 'buf'.
  if (buflen < 0) 
  {
    free(buf);
    buf = NULL;	
    xalloc_die ();
  }
  
  // Lines could start with aforementioned space in earlier implementation.  
  if (0 < current_col && (max_col - current_col > buflen))
  {
    putchar (' ');
    current_col++;
  }

  if(buf) 
  {  
    fputs (buf, stdout);
    current_col += buflen;
  }
  
  // Makes code a bit faster. 'putchar()' not to be invoked incase a '\n' irrelevant or buflen < 0 so only buffer to be dismissed.
  if (0 < current_col && !(max_col - current_col > buflen))
  {
    putchar ('\n');
    current_col = 0;
  }

  // Buffer related to 'buf' always be freed from memory.
  if(buf) free(buf);
}
