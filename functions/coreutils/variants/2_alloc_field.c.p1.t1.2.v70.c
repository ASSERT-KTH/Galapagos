The variant below has behavior that will maintain the original functionality of the given function. The minor change is that it contains error checking and handling scenarios, handling the situation where if variable `f` is negative or not within the bounds of `field_data`, it will return immediately avoiding potential undefined behaviour.

It essentially allocates memory for fields, assigns a field to a column, assigns a caption if there's one and flags the field as used.


alloc_field (int f, char const *c)
{
  /*
   * Add error checking for 'f' to avoid addressing invalid
   * indices or potential undefined behaviour.
   */
  if (f < 0 || f >= FIELD_DATA_SIZE)
    return;
    
  ncolumns++;
  
  columns = xnrealloc (columns, ncolumns, sizeof (struct field_data_t *));
   
  /* Ensure 'f' is within bounds of array indices */
  if (f < FIELD_DATA_SIZE)
    columns[ncolumns - 1] = &field_data[f];
    
  if (c != nullptr)
    columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = c;
  
  /* Ensuring field is not used before this operation */
  assert (!field_data[f].used);

  /* Mark field as used.  */
  field_data[f].used = true;
}


Note: This might give an assertion failure if same field_data is being reused which could be avoided but in context of maintaining original functionality it is kept as it is. This variant assumes FIELD_DATA_SIZE as a preset global constant representing the size of the field data. In original context, it could get fetched accordingly or evaluated with actual dataset. Also, size of field_data should always have size more than resultant increases in ncolumns.
