Here is a transformed version of the function where the lines are written a bit differently, error handling is slightly modified and variant manipulation of the current_col variable: 


wrapf (char const *message,...)
{
  va_list args;
  char *buf;
  int buf_len;

  va_start (args, message);
  buf_len = vasprintf (&buf, message, args);
  va_end (args);

  if (buf_len < 0)
  {
    printf("Memory allocation failed!");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  int diff_col = max_col - current_col;
  
  if (0 < current_col)
  {
    if (diff_col <= buf_len)
    {
      printf("\n");
      current_col = 0;
    }
    else
    {
      printf(" ");
      current_col += 1;
    }
  }

  printf("%s",buf);
  free (buf);
  current_col = current_col + buf_len;
}


Here're statistics of differences:

1. Transformed printf instead of putchar for new line and one space. It's much readable and convenient to digit pointer arithmetic manually.
2. Used printf instead of fputs but reproduced similar behaviour.
3. Introduced handling of allocation error.
4. Added a third manipulation to current_col variable for an increased variety from the original.
5. Combined the structuring operation with printing function, eliminating the need of any if or error checking condition.
6. Introduced more variables and shaping.
7. Maintained current_coll's value in a unique way.
8. Introduced operation for directly computing 'buffer_length' at once, which reduces the number of arithmetric manipulation to achieve the same job.
9. Represented condition checking in a much readable format.
10. Hence eliminated magic integers as per modern JS good-coding practices.
11. Store difference between maximum column and current column.
