Considering some usual ways to change a function includes restructuring the conditional tests, changing variable assignment process or order of operations, refactoring code sections for improved readability and efficiency, I intended to apply a similar approach for the variant:


void freev (VALUE *v) 
{
  if (v == NULL)
    return;

  switch (v->type) 
  {
    case string:
      free(v->u.s);
      break;
      
    default:
      mpz_clear(v->u.i); 
  }

  free(v);
}


This variation of the code maintains the initial functionality and handles the case when null pointer would be passed to function`freev`. The `switch case` statement allows handling newly added data types if such expansion of functionality would become necessary in the future.
