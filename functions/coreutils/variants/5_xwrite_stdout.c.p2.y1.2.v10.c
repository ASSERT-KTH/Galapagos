Here is a program variant:


xwrite_stdout (char const *buffer, size_t n_bytes)
{
  if (n_bytes == 0) return;

  ssize_t bytes_written = fwrite (buffer, 1, n_bytes, stdout);
  if (bytes_written < n_bytes)
    {
      fflush (stdout);
      if (ferror(stdout))
      {
        clearerr (stdout); /* Clear any error status. */
        error (EXIT_FAILURE, errno, _("unable to write to %s"),
        quoteaf ("standard output"));
      }
    }
}

This variant maintains the basic structure and functionality of the original code:

1. It exits the function early when `n_bytes` equals 0, effectively bypassing any concerns around writing no byte array[0].
2. It keeps a count of `fwrite` return value to `bytes_written`, signifies the actual number of bytes that are processed. This local variable saves and uses this evaluation's outcome multiple times.
3. Using `fflush`, forces it to attempt to flush its buffer to the underlying hardware immediately; this extra operation ensures its buffer correctly reflects silent error states like SIGPIPE.
4. After `fflush`, it checks explicitly via `ferror` if the output stream had an error, only then it clears said error, providing added certainty over the necessity of error handling's execution-path.
5. A small rewrite in the error message note - shifting from `error writing` to `unable to write to` adjusts semantics about the problem type, becoming more explicit that program was unsuccessful instead of abstract 'error occurring'. This semantic could be aligned to programming habits or conventions within a team.
