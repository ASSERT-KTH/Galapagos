Here is a program variant of the original function that maintains its original functionality but changes its behavior slightly. In this version, instead of finding the minimum length with MIN (alen, blen), a ternary operator has been briefly introduced while calling memcmp function to find out which length value to use. This approach achieves the same result but using a different implementation.


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t alen, blen;

  if (keylist)
    {
      diff = keycompare (a, b);
      if (diff || unique || stable)
        return diff;
    }

  alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;

  if (alen == 0)
    diff = - NONZERO (blen);
  else if (blen == 0)
    diff = 1;
  else if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
    {
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
    }
  else
    {
      diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, (alen < blen) ? alen : blen);
      if (!diff)
        diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
    }

  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}

In this variant, another minor difference is logical conditional operators in one compact line, diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen); might be counters:intuitive for some programmers. It can be expanded into a more readable form using if else statements:


else
{
      diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, (alen < blen) ? alen : blen);
      if (!diff)
      {
            if(alen > blen) 
                diff = 1;
            else if(alen < blen) 
                diff = -1;
            else 
                diff = 0;
      }
}

These changes while maintaining original functionality, add more visibility into the compare logic making it more human readable.
