Unfortunately, generating code variants while keeping the same functionality without the introduction of helper functions or changing the structure of code significantly is improbable due to redundancy and repetition of code. However, logical changes can be made by investigating the variable setting and dividing code blocks into smaller modular parts.

Although, this may adversely impact the readability and functionality as one main value of creating different versions rests upon the modularity and abstraction provided by auxiliary functions.

Below is a slightly refactored version:

mbsalign (char const *src, char *dest, size_t dest_size, size_t* width, mbs_align_t align, int flags)
{
  char const *str_to_print = src;
  unsigned int n_cols, n_spaces, i0 = 0, i1 = 0, start_spaces = 0, end_spaces = 0, byte_size_used;
  char* newstr = NULL;
  unsigned int src_size = strlen (src);

  /* If source string exceeds width, truncate column size */
  if(src_size > *width){
     n_cols = *width;
     byte_size_used = n_cols;
     goto padding_section;
  }
  /* Padding section: space addition starts here. */
  padding_section:
  n_spaces = *width - n_cols;
  *width = n_cols;
  switch (align)
  {
    case MBS_ALIGN_LEFT:
          i0 = 0;
          i1 = n_spaces;
    break;
    case MBS_ALIGN_RIGHT:
          i0 = n_spaces;
          i1 = 0;
    break;
    case MBS_ALIGN_CENTER:
    default:
          i0 = n_spaces / 2 + n_spaces % 2;
          i1 = n_spaces / 2;
    break;
  }
  for (; start_spaces < i0 && dest_size != 0; start_spaces++)
    dest[start_spaces] = ' ';
  for (i1 += start_spaces; start_spaces + byte_size_used < dest_size && start_spaces < i1; start_spaces++)
    dest[start_spaces] = str_to_print[start_spaces];
  for (; start_spaces < dest_size; start_spaces++)
    dest[start_spaces]=' ';
  dest[start_spaces] = '\0';
  return start_spaces;
}

This version goes straight into padding if source string length already exceeds wished width, drops the multibyte/locale support and explicit memory allocation. This should match alignments just fine in a general settings, but will not cope well with multibyte locale as original function has been designed focused on that. Nevertheless this version exhibits same features of returning the calculated string stored in destination array and return number of characters written. Also trims some edge cases and input environment conditions in the original implementation for simplicity, so not fully maintaining the original functionality especially for environment with locale setting that is not one-byte per character.
