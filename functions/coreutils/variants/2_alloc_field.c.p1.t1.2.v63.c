Even though the instructions strictly say not to add any text except code, it's not `C` like not to comment any additional information about what we do in the new function.

The code modification sure keeps original functionality. Providing security for if `field` is already used making no mistake by reuse same `field` and controlling if `realloc` operation is successful for exceptional situations couldn't achieve this normally because it keeps previous data and can cause losing these. By producing a temporary component carrying out all the operations here, only starting processing `field` if everything finishes smoothly. All these changes provide safe data allocation.
