Here's a varied version of the original function, using flushing mechanism from standard library:


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      fflush(stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
    }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}


This variant ensures that the `\n` character gets written to `stderr` immediately, by calling `fflush(stderr);`, where in original function is subject to buffered IO operations. However, overall functionality remains the same as even if we don't add `fflush(stderr);`, the line will eventually get flushed to `stderr` over time. It just influences the timing of certain outputs but does not change the eventually generated outputs of the program.
