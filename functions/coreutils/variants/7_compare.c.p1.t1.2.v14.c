Sure, the underlying functionality, that is, comparing two line structures and consider parameters like 'keylist', 'unique', 'stable', and 'hard_LC_COLLATE' in this context can absolutely be maintained with few adjustments available to flip the structures for comparing first or with different sequencing.

Here is a changed version of this function where structural behaviour has been modified and functionality is maintained.


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t alen, blen;

  alen = a->length - 1;
  blen = b->length - 1;

  diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));
  if(!diff)
    diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);

  if (hard_LC_COLLATE && diff == 0)
    diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);

  if ((alen == 0) && diff == 0)
    diff = - NONZERO (blen);
  else if (blen == 0)
    diff = 1;

  if (keylist && diff == 0) 
  {
    diff = keycompare (a, b);
    if (diff || unique || stable)
       return diff;
  }

  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}


The part of comparison based on `keylist` was moved down here and only to be used when `hard_LC_COLLATE` and `memcmp` don't give certain 'diff'. It helps to save computation when there is already difference known but has no side effect with the overall outcome observed.

Obviously, this new variant will undoubtedly handle some specific cases is a different way relative to the original whilst it shall maintain the same outcomes in total.

Despite this, one should always be aware of any change made especially when it could affect the computational performance (i.e., making the compare method slower). Therefore, thorough testing for these changes is always recommended.
