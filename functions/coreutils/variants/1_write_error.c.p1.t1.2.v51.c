Here is a program variant of your function. Note that the fundamental functionality is retained but the order of operations and error reporting is a bit different now.


write_error (void)
{
  int saved_errno = errno;
  
  if(saved_errno != 0) {
    error (EXIT_FAILURE, saved_errno, _("write error occurred "));
  }
  clearerr (stdout);
  fflush (stdout); 
}

The changed behavior here is the report of error only occurs with conditions unlike execute all the time before the error reported In this variant, the error will be reported before flushing the output and clearing the error state of stdout. 

Another change lies in the condition for reporting the error message; the original version doesn't conditionally check the error status (saved_errno), suggesting that the error message would always print regardless of whether a write error actually occurred or not. The new variant includes a conditional, so that the error message only prints in case of an actual write error. This conditional reporting could make adjusting to error messages a potential issue, but mostly leads to a cleaner output or log.
