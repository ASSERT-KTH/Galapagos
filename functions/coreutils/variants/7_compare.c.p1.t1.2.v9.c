Consider the updated version of the code:


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t alen, blen;

  /* Unaltered comparison - try to compare on the specified 
  keys if they are present */
  if (keylist)
  {
    diff = keycompare (a, b);
    if (diff || unique || stable)
      return diff;
  }

  /* Begin adjusted logic. Check if either length is 0 first. */
  alen = a->length - 1;
  blen = b->length - 1;
  
  if (alen == 0)
      return NONZERO (blen) ? -1 : 0;

  if (blen == 0)
      return 1;

  /* If using hard_LC_COLLATE */
  if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
    return xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);

  /* Otherwise, do normal memcmp */
  diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));

  /* Finally check differences */
  if (!diff)
    diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);

  /* Adjusted logic end. Return as formely with diff_reversed.  */
  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}

In this version of the code, controls and behavior remain the same but in a fewer lines and made tweaks to decrease the clutterness in else if statements and put return statement immediately after the if conditions thus shortening function's overall length and complexity.
