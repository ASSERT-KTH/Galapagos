Below is a slightly altered version of your function that maintains its original functionality. The major change here is reordering of operations in a way not to change the essential logic of the function.


alloc_field (int f, char const *c)
{
  // Checking if c is not null and adding its caption to our field data
  if (c != nullptr) {
    field_data[f].caption = c;
  }

  // Check if our field data is being reused
  affirm (!field_data[f].used);

  /* Mark field as used.  */
  field_data[f].used = true;  

  // Only now increment the column counter before setting 
  // columns[ncolumns] to point to our field data
  columns = xnrealloc (columns, ncolumns + 1, sizeof (struct field_data_t *));
  columns[ncolumns] = &field_data[f];
  ncolumns++; 
}


This variant does exactly the same as the original function but opts to add caption contents before reallocating memory for columns and increments the `ncolumns` only after allocating a new memory space for the new `field_data`. This ensures enhancement in readability and maintainability of the code. I also added extra commentary to provide clarity on the functionality of each section of the function, which can ultimately save time when troubleshooting or updating line of codes in future. Note that we didn't need the condition `columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = c;` in our adjusted function since we're already declaring that up before to avoid nulls. We are automatically trading off some performance gain for enhanced clarity in function understanding.
