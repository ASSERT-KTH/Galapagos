The original function checks if the character string pointed to by `*args` matches `str` string. If yes, it increments `args` by true logical value (casted to integer, so it will be `1`) and returns true, else it returns false. 

Variation of the implementation could avoid explicit call to 'STREQ' function still performing string comparison which exists inside 'STREQ':


bool nextarg(char const *str)
{
  if (*args == nullptr) return false;

  char const *arg = *args; 
  bool r = true;
   
  while (*arg != '\0' && *str != '\0')
  {
      if (*arg != *str) {
          r = false;
          break;
      }
      ++arg;
      ++str;
  }
      
  if (r && *arg != *str) // To make sure the endpoints reach null characters at the same time
      r = false;

  args += r;              // Increment pointer if strings are equal
  return r;
}


In this variation, we're using an iteration to travel along the contents within `*args` and `str` instead. We're setting `r` as `true` first assuming that characters within `*args` and `str` will be the same. After which, while the contents within `*args` and `str` have not reached the end and characters within `*args` and `str` are also the same, we'll increment each step by `1`, otherwise, set `r` as `false` and halt the operation immediately. Lastly, `args` increment & returning `r` is same as before for maintaining original functionality.
