The variant of the program could include additional functionality like logging the error messages in a file. However, the variant still does the job of the original function.


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <error.h>

extern size_t progress_len;

void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  FILE *file;

  if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
    }

  va_list ap;
  va_start(ap, fmt);
  file = fopen("log.txt", "a");
  if(file != NULL)
  {
    vfprintf(file, fmt, ap);
    fclose(file);
  }
  verror(0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end(ap);
}


Here, an important note is that in order to reproduce the original functionality of verror within our non standard `vfprintf` function, we'll have to pass a log format string that closely matches verror's output structure.

The concept behind this variant is that apart from printing the error message on `stderr` it also logs the same in a file named `log.txt`.
   
P.S.: The existence and writability of the `log.txt` file could become another error, so it must be managed appropriately according your use case.
