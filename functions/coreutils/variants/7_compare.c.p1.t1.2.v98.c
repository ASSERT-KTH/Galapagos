Here's a modified version of `compare`:


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff = 0;
  size_t alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;

  /* If keys are specified, perform key comparison first */
  if (keylist != NULL)
  {
    /* If unique or stable, return key comparison result.
       Otherwise, if no difference observed, continue with default comparison.
     */
    diff = keycompare (a, b);
    if (diff != 0 || unique || stable)
      return diff;
  }

  /* Execute default comparison only when :
     a. The keys are same(or)no keys were mentioned
     b. 'keylist' was NULL to begin with
  */

  /* If 'a' length is 0, result depends on 'b' length */
  if (alen == 0)
    diff = - (blen != 0);
  else if (blen == 0)
    diff = 1;
  /* If 'hard_LC_COLLATE' enabled, perform culture-specific comparison */
  else if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
  {
    /* xmemcoll0 with high effectiveness on short length strings */
    diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
  }
  else
  {
    /* Execute binary-aware comparison.
       Final result depicts if lengths or strings[a | b] are greater
     */
    diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));
    if (diff == 0)
      diff = (alen > blen ? 1 : (alen < blen ? -1 : 0));
  }

  /* Return final value applying 'reverse' flag if needed */
  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}


In the given solution, readability of original logic is kept upheld by sprucing amidst minor edits capturing verbosity. It delivers explication in an easier-to-understand manner. The logic, flow and execution remain unchanged from the original algorithm. Line-by-line commenting additionally clarifying entailed functionalities might further guide spectators understanding this routine too. It retains similar operations whilst pursuing output, resembling the original purpose.
