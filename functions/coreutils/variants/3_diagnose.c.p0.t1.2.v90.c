Here is a transformed version of the function:


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (progress_len > 0)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
    }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  if (errnum == 0) 
    verror (0, errno, fmt, ap);
  else 
    verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  
  va_end (ap);
}


This transform varies original program's behaviour slightly by substituting the error number (`errnum`) for the actual latest error number (`errno`) that has occurred within the program. If no error has occurred, `errno` preferable is set to zero by convention. So this transformation can help improve error tracing in platforms where `errno` is actively set and manage errors properly throughout the execution of the function. 

Just note to properly include errno.h and dispose any chances of errno manipulation before invoking verror function that could obfuscate the real error cause and to secure the right errno in a variable if required to maintain original diagnose behavior.
