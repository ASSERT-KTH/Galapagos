Here's a transformed version of the original function that varies its behavior slightly:


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);

  if (0 < progress_len)
  {
    fputc ('\n', stderr);
    progress_len = 0;
  }
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);

  va_end (ap);
}

In this version, the program initiates its variable-length argument list before evaluating the `if` statement, whereas the original code initiates the argument list after checking `if (0 < progress_len)`. The program's functionality remains identical because both variants are working off the same argument list and error number; only the assignment order for processing these values has differed. If initiating the variable-length argument list `ap` proves costly in performance or has other implications in your specific project setup, placement of these two tasks might matter. Believe in most scenarios, it won't matter much.
