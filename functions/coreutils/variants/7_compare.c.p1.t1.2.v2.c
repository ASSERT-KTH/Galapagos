The function `compare` compares two lines and returns a result based on a series of conditions. I will demonstrate a change in behavior by altering the way the lengths of lines `a` and `b` are computed. Instead of subtracting 1 from each line's length immediately, line lengths will remain as-is until they are used in a comparison. This will make it easier to read the logic involving comparing the lengths of `a` and `b`, as it doesn't involve an immediately adjusted `-1` which was part of previous version's `alen` and `blen` computation. 

Functionality remains and I assure we get same results because subtraction `1` is merely delayed, not removed, its effect remains where it plays an important role.

Function's Code:


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t alen, blen;

  if (keylist)
    {
      diff = keycompare (a, b);
      if (diff || unique || stable)
        return diff;
   }
    
  // calculate the actual line lenghts first
  alen = a->length, blen = b->length;
  
  if (alen <= 1)
    diff = - NONZERO (blen - 1);
  else if (blen <= 1)
    diff = 1;
  else if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
    {
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen, b->text, blen);
    }
  else
    {
      // -1 adjustment included here
      diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen - 1, blen - 1));
      if (!diff)
        diff = ((alen - 1) > (blen - 1)) - ((alen - 1) < (blen - 1));
    }
    
  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}
