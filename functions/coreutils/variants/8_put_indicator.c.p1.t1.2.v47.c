Here is the variation of your function that maintains original functionality with a modification of checking if the 'string' and 'len' attributes of the structure are set:


#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <signal.h>

#define STDOUT_FILENO 1

extern bool used_color;   // defined in code that we are not aware of

struct bin_str {
  char* string;
  size_t len;
};

/* Function prototypes */
void signal_init();       // defined in the code we are not aware of
void prep_non_filename_text();  // defined in code we are not aware of

void put_indicator(const struct bin_str* ind) {
  if (!used_color) {
    used_color = true;

    /* If the standard output is a controlling terminal, watch out
       for signals, so that the colors can be restored to the
       default state if "ls" is suspended or interrupted.  */
    if (0 <= tcgetpgrp(STDOUT_FILENO))
      signal_init();

    prep_non_filename_text();
  }

  //changed behavior  
  if (ind->string != NULL && ind->len > 0)
    fwrite(ind->string, ind->len, 1, stdout);
  else
    fprintf(stderr, "Input string pointer is NULL or length is not positive.\n");
}


Please keep in mind that this code snippet might not compile because some needed parts may not be included in this answer. They aren't specified as such we assume they're present in your original code: variable `used_color`, the required headers for `ioctl` or `tcgetpgrp`, as well as functions `signal_init` and `prep_non_filename_text`.
 
The modified functionality here comes in checking if 'string' exists (`ind->string` is not `NULL`) and 'len' length (`ind->len` should be more than '0') parameters of a passed structure are present; if they aren't, then some appropriate action is taken, in this case â€“ to output an error message.
