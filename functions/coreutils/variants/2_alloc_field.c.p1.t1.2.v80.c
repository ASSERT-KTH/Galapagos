This program variant retains the functionality of the original program but introduces error checking. This variant checks for function parameters that might lead to an error in runtime. For instance, it checks for `field_data[f]` evaluation error. To do this, we include a condition statement to handle any runtime error that could happen in the course of the program execution and to also return appropriate responses.

It checks whether the passed index `f` is negative or greater than the current allocated size of `field_data` array before trying to access the member, `field_data[f]`. If it is outside of acceptable range, it will allocate `field_data` to accommodate the index `f` and initialise it to avoid random memory footprints. Hence avoiding an array index out of bounds exception during the runtime.

alloc_field (int f, char const *c)
{
  if (f < 0 || f >= field_data_length) {
    /* Ensure f isn't negative or too large */
    int new_size = (f >= field_data_length) ? f + 1 : field_data_length;
    field_data = (struct field_data_t *) realloc(field_data, new_size * sizeof (struct field_data_t));
    /* Ensure new elements are initialised */
    memset(field_data + field_data_length, 0, (new_size - field_data_length) * sizeof (struct field_data_t))
    field_data_length = new_size;
  }

  ncolumns++;
  columns = xnrealloc (columns, ncolumns, sizeof (struct field_data_t *));

  columns[ncolumns - 1] = &field_data[f];

  if (c != nullptr)
    columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = c;

  affirm (!field_data[f].used);

  /* Mark field as used.  */
  field_data[f].used = true;
}
