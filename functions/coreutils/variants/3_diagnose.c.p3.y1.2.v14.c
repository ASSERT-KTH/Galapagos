Go does not directly support C-style variadic arguments. Nevertheless, `fmt` package and `log` package has methods necessary to implement similar behavior.

Here is the semantically equivalent version in Go:

go
var stdin = os.NewFile(uintptr(syscall.Stdin), "/dev/stdin")

func diagnose(errNum int, format string, a ...interface{}) {
	if progressLen > 0 {
		fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr)
		progressLen = 0
	}

	msg := fmt.Sprintf(format, a...)
	log.New(os.Stderr, "", 0).Printf("error number: %d, message: %s\n", errNum, msg)
}


In this function, string is formatted first using `fmt.Sprintf` which then gets printed out along with error number using a logger defined in `log` package. This logger is specially created to avoid prefixed date/time which is automatically added by `log.Printf`.
