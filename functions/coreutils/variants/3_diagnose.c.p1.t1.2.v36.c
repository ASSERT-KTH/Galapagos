The"C" code provided implements a custom function 'diagnose' to print error messages. However, it doesn't print any output if 'progress_len' is equal to or less than zero. Here is a minor variant of the function that maintains its functionality while also printing a custom error message when 'progress_len' is equal to or less than zero:


#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <error.h>

void diagnose(int errnum, const char *fmt, ...)
{
  extern int progress_len;

  if (0 < progress_len)
  {
    fputc ('\n', stdout);
    progress_len = 0;
  }
  else
  {
    fprintf (stdout, "Custom Error: 'progress_len' is not greater than 0!");
  }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}

In this variant, if 'progress_len' is equal to or less than zero, the function will print a custom error message to stdout.

The original and variant codes are essentially alike in their functionality. They're designed to handle variable-length argument lists and print error messages to the standard error file descriptor (stderr). 

Please note there could be more than one suitable program variants based on individual use-case scenarios and requirements while keeping the original functionality.
The displayed code contains a terminal input variable "progress_len", it should be declared and initialized somewhere in your main code.
