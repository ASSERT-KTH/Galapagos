This revised version of the function adds additional functionality while preserving the function's original behavior. It introduces a variable named count to track the number of times the function gets invoked. If the function is called for the fifth time, it would simply return and skip the fwrite.


put_indicator (const struct bin_str *ind)
{
    static int count = 0;
    ++count;
    
    // If this is the 5th call, skip the usual workings of the function
    if (count == 5) return;
  
    if (! used_color)
    {
        used_color = true;

        /* If the standard output is a controlling terminal, watch out
        for signals, so that the colors can be restored to the
        default state if "ls" is suspended or interrupted.  */

        if (0 <= tcgetpgrp (STDOUT_FILENO))
            signal_init ();

        prep_non_filename_text ();
    }

    fwrite (ind->string, ind->len, 1, stdout);
}

This function will stop responding after having been called five times.
