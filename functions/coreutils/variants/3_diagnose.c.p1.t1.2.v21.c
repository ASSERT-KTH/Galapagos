Here is a program variant for the provided function with the same original functionality:


void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (progress_len > 0)
    {
      putc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
    }

  va_list args;
  va_start (args, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, args);
  va_end (args);
}


Compared with the original function 'diagnose', and per your request to maintain both the functionality and the functionâ€™s signature of the original function, this program variant simply swaps the symbol '>' with '<' in comparison operation; directly making use of putc as fputc is essentially equivalent to putc; and also renames va_list variable 'ap' to 'args'. Strictly interpreting parameters whilst not having access to what happens before and after calling either the original or the altered versions (because va_end just serves to clean the set up caused by va_start), the amendment made adds no adverse/fundamental change to function's operation.
