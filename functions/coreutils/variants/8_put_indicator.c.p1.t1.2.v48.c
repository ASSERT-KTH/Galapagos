This version also maintains the original functionality but changes the behavior by using a static variable which is initialized only once. This allows us to append initialization-proof checking so that the initialization part (along with prep_non_filename_text() and used_color condition checking) won't be executed in the subsequent calls of the same function, thereby saving some execution time.
