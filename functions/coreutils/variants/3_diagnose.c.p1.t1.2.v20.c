In the variant of the function, I am going to consider adding a condition to check if the string fmt is null or not. It is possible that the diagnose function could be called without any formatted string to print, in that case checking this condition would theoretically prevent a possible segmentation fault:


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (!fmt)   // Checks if fmt is a null pointer
    return;  // Finish execution here if fmt is null

  if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
    }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}


So, the program's behavior stands as follows: if no fmt string is defined, the function does nothing. In comparison it won't output anything nor adjust variable, the progress_len. Hence, it has been modified but still upholds initial functionality (assuming the fmt is not NULL).
