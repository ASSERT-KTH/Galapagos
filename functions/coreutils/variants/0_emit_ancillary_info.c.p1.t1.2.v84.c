The reference implementation of this function emits ancillary information concerning some core utilities or programs including sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum, sha512sum, and some bracket or multi-call invocation information.

To maintain its original functionality but yet change its behavior, we can add additional information checks for another program other than just these. Let's say, we want to add support 'another_program' into it. For this purpose, we can thereby create a variant of a program with an additional check:


void emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
  struct infomap { char const *program; char const *node; } const infomap[] = {
    { "[", "test invocation" },
    { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
    { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "another_program", "different utilities" },
    { nullptr, nullptr }
  };

  char const *node = program;
  struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;

  while (map_prog->program && ! STREQ (program, map_prog->program))
    map_prog++;

  if (map_prog->node)
    node = map_prog->node;

  printf (_("\n%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL);

  char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);
  if (lc_messages && STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_"))
    {
      fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
               "<https://translationproject.org/team/>\n"), stdout);
    }

  char const *url_program = STREQ (program, "[") ? "test" : program;
  printf (_("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"),
          PACKAGE_URL, url_program);
  printf (_("or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, node == program ? " invocation" : "");
}

In creating this variant, the behavior of the function has changed as it now handles and emits ancillary info for the new added program but still retains the original functionality.
