Here is a program variant that checks if `fmt` is null or if `errnum` is less than zero in addition to the original functionality of the function.


#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if(errnum < 0 || !fmt) return;

  if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
    }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}


This version will do nothing and early return if `errnum` is less than zero or if `fmt` is null. This could help prevent it from encountering situations where it's asked to handle a potential error condition that it isn't designed for, preserving the program's integrity. This new version maintains the original functionality of the function, as long as "original functionality" is interpreted as "behavior when `errnum` isn't negative and `fmt` isn't null." Note that this may break backward compatibility to programs depending on this method for the removed behavior.
