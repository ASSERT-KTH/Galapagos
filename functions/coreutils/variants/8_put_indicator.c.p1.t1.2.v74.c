Here is a program variant that behaves the same way as the initial function but is implemented slightly differently:

put_indicator (const struct bin_str *ind)
{
    fwrite (ind->string, ind->len, 1, stdout);

    if (! used_color) return;

    used_color = true;

    /* If the standard output is a controlling terminal, watch out
    for signals, so that the colors can be restored to the
    default state if "ls" is suspended or interrupted.  */

    if (STDOUT_FILENO < 0 && tcgetpgrp (STDOUT_FILENO) < 0) return;

    signal_init ();
    prep_non_filename_text ();
}

In this implementation, the text from `ind->string` is always written to stdout first thanks to moving `fwrite` at the top of the function. If `used_color` is not set, the function terminates prematurely - thus staying true to the logic from the original function where those operations subsequently to the `fwrite` call wouldn't be executed either.

Then if the file descriptor associated with stdout is a negative one OR the pointer of the process group id associated with the standard output is negative, rest of the function is also not notable. 

Otherwise, this variant concludes by calling `signal_init` and `prep_non_filename_text`, even as in the initial implementation. This also abides by the expectaction set by the original function.  

This program eventually performed an equivalent role to the original now employing a novel manner exploiting negative conditions and early returns.
