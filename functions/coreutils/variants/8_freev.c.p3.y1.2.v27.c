In Go, garbage collection is managed automatically, so there are no direct equivalents of `free()` or `mpz_clear()`. However, if `VALUE` is a struct with different data types, we may wish to handle its clean up differently based off the data type. Here's a way you'd implement this given a proper `VALUE` type design. Note `interface{}` is used similar to `void*` which could represents various data types:

go
type ValueType int
const (
    String ValueType = iota
    Integer 
)

type VALUE struct {
    Type ValueType
    Data interface{}
}

func FreeV(v *VALUE) {
    if v.Type == String {
        v.Data = nil
    } else if v.Type == Integer {
        v.Data = nil
	}
	v = nil
}


In the 'free' function, `v.Data` and `v` are being set to `nil` to clear and free the memory, however, this is not necessary in Go(language does this job automatically). Nevertheless, it can be used as a good practice manually for making sure you don't have references of these variables elsewhere in your program, that would unexpected behaviour.
