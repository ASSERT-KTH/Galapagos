Here is a program variant work:


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);

  if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
    }

  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}

In this variant, the order of operations has been altered. Instead of first checking if `progress_len` is greater than 0 and then initializing the variable-length argument list `ap`, this variant first initializes `ap` and then performs the check on `progress_len`. The variadic function `verror()` is called in the same place it was in the original.
