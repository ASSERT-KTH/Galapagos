In the following variant program, maintaining every original functionality, a customized message can additionally be integrated whenever a new color setup is being initiated (denoted as "used_color" value change). However, remember that the specific functionality can be included per your unique requirements.

The "used_color" set is only the indicator made active in the original function. However, this variant, there can be an informative message, log, or something equivalent to tag and utilize it for tracking to understand when a new color setup began.

Here is the code with a small behavior change:


void put_indicator(const struct bin_str *ind)
{
    if (!used_color)
    {
        fprintf(stdout, "New color setup being initiated.\n");

        used_color = true;

        if (0 <= tcgetpgrp(STDOUT_FILENO))
            signal_init();

        prep_non_filename_text();
    }

    fwrite(ind->string, ind->len, 1, stdout);
}


Note the line, `fprintf(stdout, "New color setup being initiated.\n");` exhibits a new behavior. It will print the line "New color setup being initiated." whenever a new color is initialized to run. Besides this, everything else remains the same as the original behavior is preserved.

It's important to remember that invoking auxiliary or helper function, outputs of other types, sub-function activations, or other functionality-types contradict the requirement you espoused.
