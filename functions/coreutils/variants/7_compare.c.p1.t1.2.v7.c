This version maintains original functionality but changes insignificant details located in sorting conditions and the return statement. It uses ternary conditional operator instead of preprocessor macro.
`diff_reversed` function could be used for negative values, zeros or positive `diff` might caused by ternary expressions which this function replaces. The inversion of the original integer input is self-contained in the variant version inside `return` statement at the end of the code, ensuring maintain a correct expected return value.
Limit comparison size directly at argument passing `memcmp`. Condition elaborated above statement would takes priority when no keys are specified.
