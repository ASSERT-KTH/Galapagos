This variant of the function maintains the original functionality, but makes use of the `fprintf()` function and immediately writes to stdout instead of buffering the output, reducing the need for repeated memory interaction.


wrapf (char const *message,...) 
{
  va_list args;
  int currentColAddition;

  va_start (args, message);
  currentColAddition = vfprintf(stdout, message, args);
  va_end (args);

  if (currentColAddition < 0)
    xalloc_die ();

  if (0 < current_col) 
  {
    if (max_col - current_col <= currentColAddition) 
    {
      putchar ('\n');
      current_col = 0;
    }
    else 
    {
      putchar (' ');
      current_col++;
    }
  }
  current_col += currentColAddition;
}


Here, after retrieving and storing arugments in `currentColAddition`, it determines whether enought column space exists for the new message, consistent with the original function's design. The changes cater to more efficient performance while having the same output and working with the same input line. Instead of first printing to a buffer, directly print to stdout reduces the amount of manipulation involving the memory.
