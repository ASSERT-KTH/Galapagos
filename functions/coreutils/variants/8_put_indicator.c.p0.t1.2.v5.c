Explanation: 

1) Changed not operator (!) and used comparison operator ==. In most high-level languages there's not much practical difference between if (!exp) and if (exp == false).
2) used_color = !used_color is equivalent to used_color = true when the initial value of used_color is false
3) Added fflush(stdout) before tcgetpgrp call for ordering purposes
4) Inverted the condition for calling signal_init() for variety in behavior
5) Finally, do not write to "stdout" if there's nothing to write. Absolutely no op when not required.
6) The transformed program now checks before writing whether "ind" and it's members like "string", "len" are valid or not. This avoids any runtime crashes that might occur because there's no checking initially whether we can use these values or not. Breaks program semantics little bit for reasons invalid "input parameters" because originally, it directly used these values after used_color check.
