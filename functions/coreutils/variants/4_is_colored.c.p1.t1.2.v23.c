The given program manipulates the output only based on 'indicator_no type'. However, it is discussed below how some additional lines can be added that may potentially change its behavior while maintaining its original functionality.


is_colored (enum indicator_no type)
{
  /* Add necessary sanity check for type */
  if (type < 0 || type >= NUM_INDICATOR_NO) {
     log_error( "Invalid type in is_colored!\n" );
     return -1;
  }
  
  size_t len = color_indicator[type].len;
  char const *s = color_indicator[type].string;
  
  // reverse indicator type will be treated as colorless
  if(type == REVERSE_INDICATOR)
    return 0;

  return ! (len == 0
            || (len == 1 && STRNCMP_LIT (s, "0") == 0)
            || (len == 2 && STRNCMP_LIT (s, "00") == 0));
}

This variant introduces some changes, for example additional validation for type variable and handles a specific condition if type of indicator is set to reverse. Behaviour changes could be something impractical or non-reasonable, since only requirement was that behaviour needed to change. The greater message behind this is that each function should always validate its input - in this case 'type' - to avoid any unforeseen outcomes. Secondly, sometimes parameters would by default resulting original functionality eg. when REVERSE_INDICATOR is added after the initial design of is_colored.  It is always good coding practice to revisit older code every once in a while and see if newer elements require changes in their handling.
