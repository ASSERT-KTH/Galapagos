Here is a variant of the original function that adds additional strings relating to the translation bug report after identifying the language locale:
++
void emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
  struct infomap { char const *program; char const *node; } const infomap[] = {
    { "[", "test invocation" },
    { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
    { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { nullptr, nullptr }
  };

  char const *node = program;
  struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;

  while (map_prog->program && ! STREQ (program, map_prog->program))
    map_prog++;

  if(map_prog->node)
    node = map_prog->node;

  printf (_("\n%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL);
  
  char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);
  if (lc_messages && STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_")) {
      fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
               "<https://translationproject.org/team/>\n"), stdout);
      fputs (_("Please don't forget to include your best contact, language, and specific error details in your report.\n"), stdout);
  }

  char const *url_program = STREQ (program, "[") ? "test" : program;
  printf (_("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"),
          PACKAGE_URL, url_program);
  printf (_("or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, node == program ? " invocation" : "");
}

In this variant, the report direction for interpreting the language from the user's locale is provided together with an extra extension message guiding the user for including their contacts, affected language, and specific error details when reporting translation bugs. The functionality remains regarding use of localized messages and outputted messages accommodating the user's locale correctly. The extent of output is slightly increased because more strings are output for different languages that need to interpret the locale selected by the user for their session.
