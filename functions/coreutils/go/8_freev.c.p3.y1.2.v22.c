In Go, memory management is handled automatically by the Garbage Collector. Thus, we don't have to specifically type "free" or "delete" functions. However, if `VALUE` is a complex type or struct which holds resources like file handlers, network connections or similarly `BigInt`s (Golang version of `mpz_clear` is to set `BigInt` to 0) we might need to create a custom "clean-up" function. 

Please, first define the `VALUE` struct, since the equivalent depends on how it is defined. However, let's assume an example struct as shown below in Go equivalent. As Go being a strictly typed language, it does not allow a single field to hold different types (like C's `union`). Therefore, we'd split the data holder into a string (named s) and a BigInt (named i), and maintain "type" to determine which to clear.


go
type ValueType int

const (
	None ValueType = iota
	String
	BigInt
)

type VALUE struct {
	vtype ValueType
	s     *string
	i     *big.Int
}

func freev(v *VALUE)  {
	switch v.vtype {
	case String:
		*v.s = ""
	case BigInt:
		v.i.SetText("0")
	}
	*v = VALUE{}
}

In here, we set the field type we intend to clear back to its zero-value equivalent. For string, it is "". For mpz integers (or big.Int in golang), we reset to "0". Go garbage collector will take care of the rest. 

Take-note that unlike languages like C, Go doesn't use `free()` function to deallocate the dynamic variables instead Go runtime has the provision of Garbage collector which solves this purpose.
