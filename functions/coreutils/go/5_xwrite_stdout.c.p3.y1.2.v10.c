Unfortunately, we can't maintain exactly the same function signature while translating to Go, as Go includes return values in function signatures and treats errors differently than C. 

However, here's a function equivalent in Go following as closely as possible to the C function :

go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func xwrite_stdout(buffer []byte) error {
    n_bytes := len(buffer)
    if n_bytes > 0 {
        _, err := os.Stdout.Write(buffer)
        if err != nil {
            return fmt.Errorf("error writing %s: %v", "standard output", err)
        }
    }
    return nil
}

This function takes a buffer of bytes and tries to write it to the standard output. If there is any error during writing it wraps the error with a message that indicating what happened and where (i.e., error writing to the standard output), then returns it. It up to caller to handle or propagate error further. If everything goes smoothly it then it returns `nil`.
