The equivalent code in Go (note omitted error string indicating 'standard output' since Go's `os.Stdout.Write` function indirectly conveys it by returning an error):

go
import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func xwrite_stdout(buffer []byte, n_bytes uint64) {
    if n_bytes > 0 {
        bytesWritten, err := os.Stdout.Write(buffer[:n_bytes])
        if err != nil || uint64(bytesWritten) < n_bytes {
            fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error writing: %s\n", err)
            os.Exit(1)
        }
    }
}

In the translation:

1) `char const *buffer` is now `buffer []byte` in Go. Byte slices (`[]byte`) are modifiable and any valid change at buffer would reflect.

2) `size_t n_bytes` depends on the machine we're running the code on. So, in Go, it's replaced with the arbitrary precision types. `size_t` in C is used to count bytes, so to match 'byte' semantics, `uint64` is chosen, but exact analog depends on C implementation.

3) `_exit`, `clearerr` and `error` all effectively crashes if the write fails. In Go, that happens by doing an `os.Exit` with the same status.

4) Original C function's output is localized, but Go does not contain a direct built in mechanism for localization, so the Go function produces same message, but un-localized.

5) Although the question request is to maintain the original function's signature, unfortunately, that's not possible due to differences in both programming languages C and Go. Since slices and strings function very differently between the two languages. An exact correspondence of the input types isnâ€™t possible, because Go forces handling encoding explicitly and we cannot use a direct analog in string form. Also, we have replaced the C behavior of treating strings as character(in bytes) arrays with direct byte slices as Go promotes no assumptions for Unicode and ASCII considerations alike for direct outputs.
