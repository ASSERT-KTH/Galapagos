Assuming that VALUE is a custom Go structure similar to the type in C-code and it contains a type and u (which can be either a string or implement a Clear method like mpz in C), here is a conversion into equivalent Go-lang code:

go
func freev(v *VALUE) {
    if v.kind == str {
        v.u.s = "" // We can only set it to an empty string in Go
    } else {
        v.u.i.Clear() // Assuming u.i implements a Clear() method
    }
    v = nil          // De-referencing pointer to delete it in Go
}


In Go, it is to bear in mind that once a variable is no longer needed, the Go garbage collector automatically reclaims memory. It's different than languages like C that require explicit memory management. We explicitly only need to clean certain resources such as a file descriptor, a database connection, etc.

Important: Take into consideration that reassigning **v** to `nil` inside a function does not affect the original variable: it affects only the copy of the pointer (Go deals with arguments in a pass-by-value way). Hence, this action might not have an actual impact in real-life codes if your codebase includes data marked with an even higher lifetime. Completing 'cleaning' in Go should be based on scoping to signal the garbage collector. The provided code is considering the existing behavior of C, where the pointer's memory under the target is explicitly free-ed.
