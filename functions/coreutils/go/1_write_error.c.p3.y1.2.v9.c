The below code is a translation of the provided C code into Go:

go
import "os"

func WriteError() {
    savedErrno := os.Stderr
    defer savedErrno.Sync()

    f, err := os.Open("stdout")
    if err != nil {
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    deferred f.Close()

    if _, err := f.WriteString(savedErrno); err != nil {
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}

While translating C error management systems to Go, they can be meaningfully captured, however direct translation may lead to some semantic differences as system error handling is majorly language-dependent and may not have a one-to-one correlation in a different language. Go (unlike C)also doesn't has a direct equivalent of errno or EXIT_FAILURE. Also direct comparison with files stdout isnâ€™t offered by Go. Here we are trying to involve error in Go by opening a file stdout and trying to write error to it.
