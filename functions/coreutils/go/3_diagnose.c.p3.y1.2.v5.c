Due to the native differences between C and Go, it's hard to keep the original function signature without translating it into a Go-style function signature and semantic body that makes more applicative sense in Go. Still, considering that `varargs` are represented as `...interface{}` in Go, and `verror` is similar to Go's `fmt.Errorf`, this would be a related function in Go with a similar purpose. 


import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func diagnose(errnum int, format string, a ...interface{}) {
	if progressLen > 0 {
		fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "\n")
		progressLen = 0
	}

	s := fmt.Sprintf(format, a...)
	err := fmt.Errorf("%s Errno: %d", s, errnum)
	fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
}

In C, the diagnostic function serves to print a formatted error message to `stderr`. Instead, the Go version prints to `os.Stderr`. Since Go doesn't have direct go-to-error number handling, an `errnum` parameter is fitted into the custom error message of `fmt.Errorf()` as `Errno: %d`.  

Some small syntactic liberties are were made so that Go concepts, like errnums didn’t clash with the original C syntax and semantics.

Unlike in C, len in Go is not semantically part of the compared struct or array but a standalone function that doesn’t mutate what is given to it.

One important note is functions such as va_start, va_end, verror in C, don't have direct equivalents in Go. This is because Go doesn't operate with low-level system calls like C. In Go, os package, generic error manipulation, and formatting tools serve the purpose of low-level system logging interactions of the diagnostic function originally written in C.
