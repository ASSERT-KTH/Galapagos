In Go, function equivalency to the provided C code cannot entirely be achieved due to deterministic differences between C and Go. However, the most semantically close version that maintains the original function's input is below:

Go
import (
        "fmt"
        "log"
    	"os"
)

var progressLen int

func diagnose(errNum int, fmt string, a ...interface{}) {
    if progressLen > 0 {
        fmt.Fprint(os.Stderr, "\n")
        progressLen = 0
    }
    verror(0, errNum, fmt, a...)
}

func verror(priority, errNum int, fmt string, a ...interface{}) {
    errorMsg := fmt.Sprintf(fmt, a...)
    if errNum != 0 {
        log.Printf("%s: %s\n", errorMsg, os.strerror(errNum))
    } else {
        log.Println(errorMsg)
    }
}


Explanation:
1. Go programming language does not contain a standard analogue to the variadic arguments (`va_list`, `va_start`, `va_end`). Instead, Go utilizes multiple ("variadic") arguments via syntax `...interface{}`.
2. The built-in `log` module replaces both `verror` function and `stderr`.
3. For error formatting and presentation, we have used the built-in Sprintf from the fmt package to format our string and any associated variables. The variables them passed using `a...` .
4. The standard `log` lib is typically optimal to deal with recorded errors along with necessary details.
5. Go doesn't support os.strerror or an identical function for system error messages so we couldnâ€™t translate line by line for this '+' as it contains. For a C library call to obtain a textual message for system error code (`os.strerror`), Go lacks this mechanism. It, otherwise should grab Error interface in case of error. Given the nature of returns of C's strerror call, translating it into Go isn't direct.`
