Sorry, but Go doesn't support functions with variable number of parameters in the same manner as C. Also, idiomatic error handling in Go differs significantly from C. You can perhaps use the `fmt` package to create something that behaves similarly, but given the constraints, a semantically equivalent function in Go could be impractical to implement. 

The following is an attempt to give an idea how diagnostic messages can be dealt with:

go
import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

func diagnose(errnum int, fmtStr string, a ...interface{}) {
	if errnum > 0 {
		fmtStr = fmtStr + " Error number: " + fmt.Sprintf("%d", errnum)
		log.Printf(fmtStr, a...)
	}
}


This function receives a copy type of error number, a format string followed by multiple interfaces i.e. it tries to interpret the C function behavior to some extent but due to above-mentioned reasons, truly semantically equivalent function isn't possible.
