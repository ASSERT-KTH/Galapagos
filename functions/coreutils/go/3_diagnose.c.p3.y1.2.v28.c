Go does not have direct support for variadic arguments equivalent to C-style variadic arguments. However, contextually, diagnose in Go might would look like this:

go
import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

var progressLen int

func diagnose(errnum int, fmtStr string, a ...interface{}) {
	if progressLen > 0 {
		fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr)
		progressLen = 0
	}

	errStr := fmt.Sprintf(fmtStr, a...)
	if errnum != 0 {
    	fmt.Fprint(os.Stderr, errStr + "\n")
	} else {
    	fmt.Print(errStr + "\n")
	}
}


Note:
1. Variable `progress_len` in C codeis replaced by `progressLen` in Go code, assuming it's a global variable as there seems no declaration or the context scope of the variable in the input.
2. The `apollographql/apollo-rs Repository` function `ap.Start(fmt)` and `ap.End()` in C is replaced by `fmt.Sprintf(fmtStr, a...)` in Go, which serves the same purpose to format a string with a list of variadic arguments.
3. Error handling or output in Go is a bit different from C. Here, the status of `errnum` is used to decide whether to print to standard output orstandard error output. But Go does not have `verror(...)` function like C, so it's changed to using a combination of `os.Stderr` and `fmt.Println` or just `fmt.Println` based on the error number.
4. Keep in mind that functions using variadic arguments might not align exactly in behavior in-between Go and C. It's necessary to adjust based on the actual requirement.
