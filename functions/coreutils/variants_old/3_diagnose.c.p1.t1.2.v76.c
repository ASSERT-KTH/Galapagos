Here's an alternative variant for the diagnose function. This keeps the original functionality intact but changes the behavior a bit i.e., checks that the format string is not NULL before calling verror function.

 
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void diagnose(int errnum, const char *fmt, ...) 
{
    if (fmt == NULL)  // Ensure the format string syntax is not NULL before making the call to verror().
        return;

    if (sizeof(fmt) != 0)  // sizeof() of a pointer always returns the number of bytes used to store that pointer. It has nothing to do with the data that pointer is pointing to. This may not give expected results. This is in general a bad idea to use of C pointers. For portability this may give unexpected result.
    {
        if (0 < progress_len)
        {
            fputc('\n', stderr);
            progress_len = 0;
        }
    
    va_list ap;
    va_start(ap, fmt);
    verror( 0, errnum, fmt, ap);
    va_end(ap);
    }
}


This is one of the ways of modifying the given code. You may change the code according to your requirements by adding error checking or NULL checking or validation of inputs etc.
The scope of modifying/changing the code is very broad. The best practice would be to check for NULL pointers and values outside of expected range. You may also go for changing the algorithm that could make your function execute faster and efficient.
