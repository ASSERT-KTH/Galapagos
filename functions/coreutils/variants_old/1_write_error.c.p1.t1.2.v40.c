void write_error (void)
{
  int saved_errno = errno;
  
  // First, check if there is any error to report
  if(saved_errno) {
      // Try to mitigate any potential problems by cleaning everything up
      fflush(stdout);
      clearerr(stdout);

      // There was an error; let's report it. Use.saved_errno to maintain necessary functionality
      error(EXIT_FAILURE, saved_errno, "Write error has occurred");  
  } else {
      // There was no error to report; continue as normal.
  }  
}

In this revised version, we add a conditional before proceeding to call error(). This introduces the change in behavior: If saved_errno is "true" (or REALLY represents an error), our function will call fflush(), clearerr() and error() as before. If saved_errno is "false" (which should mean that there has been no error), the function will quietly proceed to the end without effectively doing anything. The original behavior in case of an error is preserved. Best practice would probably isolate error checking within the error() function, but adjusting that here requires changing structure of original function, which instruction explicitly prevent.

Note: C doesn't evaluate numbers into Boolean values as exactly equating 0 as false, others ("true") way. Usually, accepted codes for errors (non-zero values) following POSIX standards, errno follows this too. Therefore expression of this conditional makes sense to effectively determine error did or didn't occur.

The abnormal/normal situations noted above, why you use errno explained reasons. The message to the error() call is human-readable string. Typically, internationalization is properly handled by the parent application's localization. However, it depends on exact codebase deploying this method.
