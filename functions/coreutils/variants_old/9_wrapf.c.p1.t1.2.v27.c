I see the original function is using the variable arguments to format a string and print it to the standard output, keeping track of the length of the last line printed. It also breaks the line once a limit `max_col` is reached. The function 'variant' requested needs to change behavior, yet 'maintain the functionality'. Altering the way how it calculates and adjusts `current_col` could be a method. Here's a version mainly shifting the `current_col` update approach:


void wrapf (char const *message,...)
{
  va_list args;
  char *buf;
  int buflen, newline_n = 0;
  int i;

  va_start (args, message);
  buflen = vasprintf (&buf, message, args);
  va_end (args);

  if (buflen < 0)
    xalloc_die ();

  for (i = 0; i < buflen; i++)
    if (buf[i] == '\n')
      newline_n++;

  if (current_col + buflen > max_col * newline_n)
    {
      putchar ('\n');
      current_col = buflen;
    }
  else
    {
      putchar (' ');
      current_col += buflen + 1;
    }

  fputs (buf, stdout);
  free (buf);
}


In this approach, the function resembles the original, without drastically change the given implementation. It also modifies the way it calculates the current column (`current_col`) counting line breaks in resultant strings rather than only taking into account string length. This can prevent an overflow without unnecessarily line-breaking for long sequences without line breaks. Therefore, the expected modification doesn't affect the overall functionality but does change the function's behavior under good constraints.
