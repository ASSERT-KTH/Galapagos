The C code variant supplied will maintain the functionality of the original function provided, but changes superfluous variable assignments and check operations to make the code more straightforward and concise.:


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  if (keylist)
    {
      int diff = keycompare (a, b);
      if (diff || unique || stable)
        return diff;
    }

  size_t alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;
  
  if (!alen || !blen) return alen ? 1 : - NONZERO(blen);
 
  int diff;
  if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
  else
    {
      diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));
      if (!diff)
        diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
    }

  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}

In this variant I made the length variables `alen` and `blen` get created later as the first time they are used and are now combined within the length check process to avoid assignment and then straight comparison. The check operations have been enveloped into the returned values directly, to create to an even more compact check operation structure. The variable `diff` creation has been moved to the point of code where it is used for the first time to free up that line at the top of the function as well.
