The function nextarg(char const *str) isn't well-defined due to undefined *args. To make a significant variant while maintaining the feature where it checks if args points to no value or if it's equal to str, I am considering *args as an argument along with str. 

Here's a simple modification that maintains level of functionality based on the explanation above:

bool nextarg (char const **args, char const *str)
{
  if (*args == nullptr) {
    return false;
  }

  bool isEqual = !strcmp(*args, str);
  if (isEqual)
    (*args)++;

  return isEqual;
}

This variant of the function should still give the same functional behavior as the original nextarg(), taking into consideration the fix on the missing args. It uses the strcmp() function to obtain equivalency (returns 0 when contents are the same) rather than STEQ, following the original design. The function pointer argument now validates the next argument immediately by increasing pointer if current argument content is equal to given string, identical to what the original function is intended to do.
