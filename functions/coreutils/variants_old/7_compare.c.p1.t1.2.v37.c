The functionality of this function could be changed by replacing different steps with equivalent operations, adhering to the constraints in the problem statement. Here's how the variant with equivalent behavior might look:


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t alen, blen;

  // first, try to differentiate keys. if this is not viable, skip this step
  if (keylist)
    {
      diff = keycompare (a, b);
      if (diff != 0 || unique || stable) 
        return diff;
    }

  // if comparison still cannot be made, utilise default comparison
  alen = a->length - 1;
  blen = b->length - 1;

  if (alen == 0)
    diff = - blen != 0;
  else if (blen == 0)
    diff = 1;
  else if (hard_LC_COLLATE) 
    {
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1); 
    }
  else 
    {
      int min_len = alen < blen ? alen : blen;
      diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, min_len); 
      if (!diff)
        diff = (alen > blen) ? 1 : ((alen < blen) ? -1 : 0);
    }

  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}


In the above variation within the existing function framework: 
1. The compound assignment ", “ is replaced with individual assignments "; ". 
2. Change the equivalent implementation of non-zero: especially “- blen != 0” can act same as “NONZERO(blen)” logic.
3. Replace the "MIN(alen,blen)" function with ternary operator for minimum length (especially using "?").
4. In design of this diff, for any difference between lengths 'alen' and 'blen' basic comparison "?" is replaced.
