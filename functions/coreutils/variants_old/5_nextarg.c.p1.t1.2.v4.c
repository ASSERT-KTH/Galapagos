Sorry, but there seems to be a few inconsistencies in your given code. Function name 'nextarg' and parameter 'str' are inconsistent with the objects used inside function 'args'. Also, the 'STREQ' function and 'args' variable are not defined. Hence, creating a variant of this function would be challenging without the full understanding of what it's doing. Normally, 'nextarg' would possibly derive an argument from a string while incrementing the argument provided.

Here's a common approach on reference implementation of such a function. It gets the next 'token' from a string given a delimiter:


char* nextarg(char* str, const char* delim)
{
  static char* token;
  if(str != nullptr)
  {
    token = strtok(str, delim);
  }
  else
  {
    token = strtok(NULL,delim);
  }
  return token;
}

Please provide full correct details so we could provide a variant to the exact function you have.
