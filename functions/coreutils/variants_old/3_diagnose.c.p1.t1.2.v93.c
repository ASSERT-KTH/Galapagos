The original function prints to standard error. The behavioral change could be that we print both to standard error and to a file, for instance "log.txt".


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <error.h>

 void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;

      FILE * f = fopen("log.txt", "a");
      if (f != NULL)
      {
        fputc ('\n', f);
        fclose (f);
      }
    }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);

  va_list ap2;
  va_start (ap2, fmt);
  FILE * f = fopen("log.txt", "a");
  if (f != NULL)
  {
    vfprintf (f, fmt, ap2);
    fclose (f);
  }
  va_end (ap2);
}


The new version of `diagnose` maintains the original functionality but it includes the feature to writes the error message to the "log.txt" file. In the code, `fopen("log.txt","a")` opens the "log.txt" file in append mode (doesn't truncate the file if it already exists), and the message is added to the file by the `vfprintf()` statement. If the file can not be opened for some reason, it simply skips adding messages to it â€“ maintaining some of its original functionality.
