The variation of the program maintains the original functionality but has modified variable names from "diff, alen, blen" to "difference, lengthOfA, lengthOfB" to add more clarity. Variables names are selected based on their purpose, they are self-explanatory which improves code readability. And itâ€™s better practice to employ full variable names than their short cryptic ones, thereby making your code much easier to understand.
