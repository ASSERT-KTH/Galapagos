This version of the function introduces a static variable `is_first_call`. This behaves like a global variable but its scope is limited to the function only. Thus, its value is retained between function calls. On the first call of the function, `is_first_call` is `true`, and the code in the `if` statement is run once. After this, `is_first_call` is set to `false`, thus the code in the `if` block will no longer run in subsequent calls of `put_indicator` during the runtime of the program. This effectively maintains the original functionality but changes the behavior as requested.
