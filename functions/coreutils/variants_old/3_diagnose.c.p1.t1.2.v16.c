The requested variant could add logging of the error messages into a file. Here's how you could do it:


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <error.h>

void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...) {
    if (0 < progress_len) {
        fputc ('\n', stderr);
        progress_len = 0;
    }

    FILE *log_file = fopen("error_log.txt", "a");
    if (log_file != NULL) {
        va_list ap;
        va_start (ap, fmt);
        vfprintf(log_file, fmt, ap); 
        fputs("\n", log_file); 
        va_end (ap); 
    }

    va_list ap;
    va_start (ap, fmt);
    verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
    va_end (ap);

    if (log_file != NULL) {
        fclose(log_file);
    }
}

In this variant, the both area, namely on the standard error output and human-readable message are logged into a file called `error_log.txt`. Only the error messages that appear after any "%'s" in FMT are logged, which might generally be the program's name and some contention about what went wrong. Note that file handling errors are ignored.

This requires appropriate permissions for the working directory, as the code needs to write into a file. You also need to guard against file handling errors for robustness, though such precautions are omitted here per instructions to focus purely on functionality.
