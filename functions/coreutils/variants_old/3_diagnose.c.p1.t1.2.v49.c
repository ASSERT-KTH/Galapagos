A possible variant of the code could handle edge cases by ensuring `fmt` is not NULL before working with it. See this implementation.


void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (fmt == NULL) 
    return;
  
  if (0 < progress_len) 
  {
    fputc ('\n', stderr);
    progress_len = 0;
  }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}


This function maintains the same basic functionality as the original, replicates the original's error handling procedure, and still calls `verror` for error diagnostics. The main difference is that it only executes when `fmt` can be convert to a valid string, preventing complaints about undefined behavior when a null character array pointer gets received.
