Here's an alternate version of the function which maintains its original functionality but slightly modifies its behavior:


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);

  if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
      verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
    }
  else 
    {
       verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
    }

  va_end (ap);
}


In this transformation, the order of operations has been adjusted, with the variability argument 'ap' initialized before the conditional statement. This still affects program execution very slightly do document insertion or deletion returns. In this new organization, regardless of whether 'progress_len' is greater than 0 or not, 'verror' is invoked right after '\n' gets possibly print to 'stderr’. This programming transformation only slightly changes the function’s behavior by ensuring the 'ap' variable is always initialized and ready when 'verror' is executed.
