Below is a revised variant of the provided C function that changes its structure but to a large extent maintains the same behavior. This function continues calling another function named "diff_reversed()".


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  unsigned long alen, blen;
  int diff = 0;

  if (keylist)
  {
    diff = keycompare (a, b);
    if (diff || unique || stable)
      return diff_reversed(diff, reverse);
  }

  alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;

  /* prioritize comparison of lengths over content
  in case where there're no keys or keys are the same */
  if (alen != blen)
    diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
  /* in chase the lengths are the same compare the content (only if there are keys specified) */
  else 
  {
    if (keylist) 
    {
      if (hard_LC_COLLATE) {
        diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
      } 
      else 
      {
        diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, alen);
      }
    } 
  }
  
  return diff_reversed(diff, reverse );
}


Note that the revised function, in the absence of any valid keys (different keys for lines `a` & `b` or keys are not specified), would bypass content comparison altogether and will purely decide the `diff` (and hence `sort`) based on the length of the lines (except where the length is the same across both). Consequently, this version ought to run a bit faster for cases when no keys are present or the keys for lines are identical; an additional condition where content comparison is strided as of the new priority placed on length-based comparisons over content-based ones.
However, you would need to be aware if the original intent ought to perform line content comparison at any case since keyless lines or lines with identical keys might not prefer a pure length basis sort but might prefer even mixed content to be considered for a sort (which is implied under the original design). If the latter comprehension aligns with your probable intent, then the original function would best work for you!
