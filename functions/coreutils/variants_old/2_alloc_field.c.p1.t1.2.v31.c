Sure, one way to change the behavior while maintaining similar functionality is to perform a few safety checks and handle exceptions that might occur within the function body.

Here's a revised version of the same function with some additions:


void alloc_field (int f, char const *c)
{
  if(f < 0 || ncolumns <0)
  {
      printf("Invalid field index or unallocated data. Initialization terminated.");
      return;
  }

  struct field_data_t *temp = xnrealloc (columns, ncolumns+1, sizeof (struct field_data_t *));
  if (temp == NULL) 
  {
      printf("Failed to allocate memory. Initialization terminated.");
      return;
  }
  else
  {
      columns = temp;
      ncolumns++;
  }

  if (c == nullptr) 
  {
      columns[ncolumns - 1] = &field_data[f];
      columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = "No caption provided";
  }
  else
  {
      columns[ncolumns - 1] = &field_data[f];
      columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = c;
  }

  if(field_data[f].used)
  {
      printf("This field is already used. Try different field.");
      columns[ncolumns - 1].used = false;      
      return;
  }

  /* Mark field as used.  */
  field_data[f].used = true;
}


Key changes are as follows:

1. The function now checks for safety conditions associated with invalid index and unallocated data(that the field index 'f' is positive and 'ncolumns' is non-negative).

2. Before doing reallocation operation, the function creates temporary pointer, 'temp', which is helpful to avoid memory leaks in the original pointers if reallocation fails due to memory problems.

3. Now the function can handle for a nullptr caption. It will assign "No caption provided" to 'caption'.

4. The check 'field_data[f].used' ensure the field is not used otherwise, it throws a warning message and prevent assigning of fields that were already marked on by earlier call of the function.

The revised function does more exception handling and early program exiting to save work/memory in the event something goes wrong. However, it's still largely doing the same core task of creating (sometimes reallocating) memory for some new data field.
