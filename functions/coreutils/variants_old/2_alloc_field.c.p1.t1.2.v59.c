Here's a variant of the original `alloc_field` function that also includes error checking which modifies the behavior of the original function:


void alloc_field (int f, char const *c)
{
  if(f < 0 || f >= MAX_NUM_FIELDS) {
    printf("Invalid field index.\n");
    return;
  }

  ncolumns++;
  columns = (struct field_data_t **)realloc(columns, ncolumns * sizeof (struct field_data_t *));
  if(columns == NULL) {
    printf("Allocation failure.\n");
    return;
  }

  columns[ncolumns - 1] = &field_data[f];
  if (c != nullptr) {
    columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = c;
  }

  if(field_data[f].used) {
    printf("Warning: field is already marked as used.\n");
    return;
  }

  /* Mark field as used.  */
  field_data[f].used = true;
}


First, this variant checks the provided field number `f`, to prevent an out-of-bounds array access should `f` be negative or should it exceed the maximum number of fields. The macro `MAX_NUM_FIELDS` should be defined somewhere else in the program and expresses the size of the `field_data` array. Without this check, illegal memory access could occur, causing ``segmentation fault`` errors.

Second, the call to `realloc` is immediately followed by an error checker to confirm that the re-allocation was successful and handle the allocation failure, where the program might otherwise continue to incorrectly function.

Lastly, if the field is already used, instead of silently affirming, the variant produces a warning message. 

The variant preserves the original function's behavior related to adding a field, adjusting the array of columns, and storing/highlighting caption if provided, but adds adjustments and certain safeguards on top of its original scenario mattering functionality manipulation and/or processing.
