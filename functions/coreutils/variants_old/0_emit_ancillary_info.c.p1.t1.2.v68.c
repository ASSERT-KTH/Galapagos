Here, we keep the original functionality that the function uses to output information regarding online help and documentation, but interleave the output with additional messages that announce which section of output is coming up next. 

This variant of the function can thus appear as follows:


void emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
  struct infomap { 
    char const *program; 
    char const *node; 
  } const infomap[] = {
    { "[", "test invocation" },
    { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
    { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { nullptr, nullptr }
  };

  char const *node = program;
  struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;

  while (map_prog->program && ! STREQ (program, map_prog->program))
    map_prog++;

  if (map_prog->node)
    node = map_prog->node;
    
  printf (_("\n%s Product Support is Here\n"), PACKAGE_NAME);
  printf (_("%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL);

  char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);
  if (lc_messages && STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_"))
    {
      printf (_("\n%s Language Support\n"), PACKAGE_NAME);
      fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
               "<https://translationproject.org/team/>\n"), stdout);
    }

  char const *url_program = STREQ (program, "[") ? "test" : program;
  printf (_("\n%s Documentation\n"), PACKAGE_NAME);
  printf (_("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"),
          PACKAGE_URL, url_program);
  printf (_("or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, node == program ? " invocation" : "");
}


By intermingling the `printf()` statements within the previous implementation, the current behavior is retained and still adheres to the restrictions of only outputting the function's code, application documentation and support instructions. No helper nor auxiliary functions are utilized in this case. This instance remains the function's signature intact and does not distract from its proper working. The additional `printf()` outputs guide the user through the function by add labels to different sections of the output.
