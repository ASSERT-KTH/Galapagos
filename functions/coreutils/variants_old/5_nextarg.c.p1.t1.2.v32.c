You provided a code segment "nextarg" with incorrect references like args, STREQ which are undefined in the context provided. Assuming the objective of this function might be to compare the first character of a string to a given one, making it equivalent in functionality yet little different involves taking plenty of liberties:  


#include <stdbool.h>

char *ptr;

bool nextarg (char const *str)
{
    if (*ptr == '\0')
    return false;

    else
    {
        bool r = (*ptr == *str);
        ptr += r;
        return r;
    }
}

Here, nextarg function retrieves the next argument from a global character pointer "ptr". It increments the pointer if the first character of str matches with the character at ptr. If there is match, the function returns true i.e., '1' and also increments ptr by '1', else stays at the same location and returns false i.e., '0'. It also handles the case where ptr is pointing to end of string i.e., '\0'.
