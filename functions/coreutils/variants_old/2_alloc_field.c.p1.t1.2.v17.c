Below is the code for the program variant. There are no changes in its functionality but in its physical structuring. Changes in the commented explanations were added as well. All auxiliary functions and auxiliary variables have been maintained while restricting function output aside from the given non-specific codes. The function signature as well remains the same as in the reference code implementation. 


alloc_field(int f, char const *c) 
{
  ncolumns++;
  // Dynamically reallocates memory for columns array
  columns = xnrealloc(columns, ncolumns, sizeof (struct field_data_t *));
  // Stores the address for specific field data inside the array
  columns[ncolumns - 1] = &field_data[f];

  // Checks and assigns value for caption if input is not null
  if (c != nullptr) 
  {
    columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = c;
  }

  // Asserts the misuse condition for field data: Assures that it is not used
  assert (!field_data[f].used);

  // Tags the field data as used upon completion of process
  field_data[f].used = true;
}
