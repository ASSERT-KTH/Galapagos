Below is a program variant that changes the behavior of the original function slightly. It flushes the output stream after writing a newline character, should `progress_len` be greater than 0 to ensure that any buffered characters are written immediately. Meanwhile, the function maintains its original functionality of printing and error handling.


void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
    if (progress_len > 0)
    {
        fputc ('\n', stderr);
        progress_len = 0;
        fflush(stderr);
    }

    va_list ap;
    va_start (ap, fmt);
    verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
    va_end (ap);
}
