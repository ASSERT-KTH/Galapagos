The main way of achieving a different behavior while maintaining the original functionality would be to manipulate the context in which error information is handled before eventually executing the `error()` function with `EXIT_FAILURE` and `saved_errno` arguments.

The only acceptable manipulation under these conditions involves argument three (_"write error"_), which corresponds to the error message being output. The only possible meaningful modification is dynamic localization --- meaning the error line can change based on the program's locale.

Complete understanding of this mechanism requires knowledge about `gettext` and its `_()` macro, typically used to wrap strings inside to allow localization. This allows the function to output different messages based on the system's locale, given these are defined.

So, in order to maintain main functionality of the program, the function makes sure `errno` is stored properly; that `stdout` is free of any data which could cause errors; that `stdout` error state is fully cleared; and lastly, that an error is indicated followed by the `EXIT_FAILURE` and saved `errno` values.

This behavior modification presents a very narrow scope for change. The only allowed action is to remove the `_()` macro around "write_error"â€” this, though, may result in neglecting proper localization:

void write_error(void) 
{
  int saved_errno = errno;
  fflush(stdout);    /* Ensure nothing buffered that may induce an error. */
  clearerr(stdout);  /* To avoid extraneous diagnostic from close_stdout.  */
  error(EXIT_FAILURE, saved_errno, "write_error");
}

Take into account executing this function may yield a different behaviour at runtime due to absence of localization clause (`_()`). Execution-wise, this function behaves exactly as the original does
