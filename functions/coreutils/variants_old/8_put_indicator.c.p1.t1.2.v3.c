Consider Adding error checking for fwrite as an enhancement.
In C programming, error checking is crucial for creating robust programs. It plays a vital role in delivering high-quality codes. Here, we have added an error checking mechanism for fwrite function. The updated function is then:


#include <stdio.h>

void put_indicator (const struct bin_str *ind)
{
    size_t ret;
    
    if (! used_color)
    {
        used_color = true;

        /* If the standard output is a controlling terminal, subject to raise
            a signal, allowing the colors to be reset to the default state if 
            "ls" is suspended or interrupted.  */

        if (0 <= tcgetpgrp (STDOUT_FILENO))
            signal_init ();

        prep_non_filename_text ();
    }

    ret = fwrite (ind->string, ind->len, 1, stdout);
    if (ret != ind->len)
    {
      ferror(stdout);
    }
}

In this modification, the fwrite function outputs directly to 'stdout'. The variable 'ret' stores its return value and compares this to 'ind->len'. If there was an error writing the data or if it wrote less than expected, i.e., 'ret' and 'ind->len' are unequal, then the perror function outputs the relevant error message, thus replacing stdout's perror call with ferror(stdout) because the original usage was incorrect for stdout's type. So make fputs(stderr) with appropriate handling conversation.

This helps in tracking any issues related to this function's output, making it is easier to identify any potential issues that might occur.
