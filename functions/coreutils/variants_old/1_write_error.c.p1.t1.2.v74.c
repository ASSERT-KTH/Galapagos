Here is a program variant that changes the behavior but maintains the original functionality of the function.

write_error (void)
{
  int temp = errno;
  clearerr (stdout);   /* Moved clearerr (stdout) function up to avoid unnecessary diagnostics */
  fflush (stdout);     /* Moved fflush (stdout) after clearerr to adjust error buffering */
  int saved_errno = temp;
  error (EXIT_FAILURE, saved_errno, _("write error"));
}

The function is still producing same results but the levels at which the function clearerr () and fflush() are called are interchanged, hence changing the overall behavior.
