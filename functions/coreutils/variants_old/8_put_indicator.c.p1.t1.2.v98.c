Here's a version that has the same functionality, but checks for a null pointer before trying to use the `ind` argument.


void put_indicator(const struct bin_str* ind) 
{
    if (!ind)
        return;
       
    if (!used_color) 
    {
        used_color = true;

        /* If the standard output is a controlling terminal, watch out
        for signals, so that the colors can be restored to the
        default state if "ls" is suspended or interrupted. */

        if (0 <= tcgetpgrp(STDOUT_FILENO))
            signal_init();
    
        prep_non_filename_text();
   }

   fwrite(ind->string, ind->len, 1, stdout);
}

This variant will not crash when passed a null pointer. If `put_indicator` is meant to be part of a larger system where it's guaranteed to always receive a valid pointer, then this modification is unnecessary, but it could help prevent bugs if that's not the case.
