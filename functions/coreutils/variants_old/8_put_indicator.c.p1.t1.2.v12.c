Sure, let's keep the fundamental functionality of the function while modifying the order of execution and utilizing an added conditional:


put_indicator (const struct bin_str *ind) {
    if (! used_color || (ind && ind->string)) {
        used_color = true;
    
        if (ind && ind->string)
            fwrite (ind->string, ind->len, 1, stdout);
    
        /* Synchronization with the standard output terminal is conducted
        here as long as a call directly to the indicator structure can be performed safely.  */
    
        if (0 <= tcgetpgrp (STDOUT_FILENO)) {
            signal_init();
            prep_non_filename_text ();
        }
    }
}


Here's what I've done:
- I've added an additional or logical condition (`||` operator) where the function will set `used_color = true` if `ind` and `ind->string` are both not NULL.
- I swapped the `if(0 <= tcgetpgrp (STDOUT_FILENO))` scope with `fwrite (ind->string, ind->len, 1, stdout);`. This doesn't change overall what happens but only the sequence.
- `ind && ind->string` was added as an additional condition to ensure that `fwrite` is executed only when `ind->string` is not NULL. This contributes to a safer manipulation of data since NULL pointers aren't handled, this however may not exist in your actual code's context. 

The inherent function maintain its original functionality, though code management and safety are accommodated better.

Note: Considerations about `ind->len` and `ind->string` being consistent or out of bounds were not considered given your original code snippet. This could lead to undefined behaviour in real-world code context.
