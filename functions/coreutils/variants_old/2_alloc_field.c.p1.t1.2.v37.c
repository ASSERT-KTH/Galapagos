Below is a variant of the function that achieves similar functionality but through a different sequence of operations. While maintaining the programming code comparable to the original function, the behavior has been shifted to decouple memory allocation and the setting of a new column with a guarantee of field availability.


alloc_field(int f, char const *c) {
  /* Checking if field is already used. If the field is marked 'used', this function should ideally not have been called. But in case it does get called, simply returning will prevent overwriting or double allocation problems connected to 'used' field.
  */
  if (field_data[f].used) return;

  // Mark field as used. 
  field_data[f].used = true;

  // Ensure columns array has enough space for new column
  columns = xnrealloc(columns, ncolumns + 1, sizeof(struct field_data_t *));

  // Updating new column's position with field_data reference
  columns[ncolumns] = &field_data[f];

  // If caption string is provided, specify it for the new column
  if(c != nullptr) columns[ncolumns]->caption = c;

  // Accounting the new column
  ncolumns++;
}


The variant function starts checking barring field usage and terminates others or unused field is exercised. `field_data[f].used` status mark supporting method full application before any memory-related endeavor. Additional column is inserted, location awarded, characterised, and latterly lengthened available elementary count. The modification intends bypass version primitive function infrastructure redundancy. The variant be responsible consistency the earlier function element-wise as well improved validation error bypass fundamental operations null elements. Innovations emerge checking, placement and field allocation likelihood first, rely memory realloc ensuring before using extra column. The alternate implementation might utilise practical setting in definite constraint application system resources proficiency.
