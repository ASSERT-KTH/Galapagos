Here is a slightly modified version of the original function which contains similar functionality but does not output spaces or newlines other than those requested by the caller. 


wrapf2(const char *message, ...)
{
    va_list args;
    char *buf;
    int buflen;

    va_start(args, message);
    buflen = vasprintf(&buf, message, args);
    va_end(args);

    if (buflen < 0)
    {
        xalloc_die();
    }

    // Always print out the result, without inserting additional spaces or newlines
    fputs(buf, stdout);
  
    // After every character printed increments current_col to determine maximal column size
    while (*buf != '\0') 
    {
        current_col++;
        buf++;
    }

    // If current_col is not greater than maximum column size underline the column
    // Automatically output new line and reset current_column to 0 
    if (current_col > max_col) 
    {
        putchar('\n');
        current_col = 0;
    }
}


This modified code makes the code more general, as output of unnecessary spaces or newlines that might decrease readability are eliminated. After getting data from caller and putting them into a new buffer and stdout, it will calculate the size of current_col until it reaches max_col.

Note that "max_col", "current_col", and "xalloc_die()" should have been defined elsewhere in the actual code as they are missing here. The function "vasprintf" is a GNU-specific extension function used here to create formatted string with stdout.
