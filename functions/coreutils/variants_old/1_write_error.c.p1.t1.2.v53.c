A code that alters the behaviour of the function while maintaining the functionality can be written as follows:


write_error (void) 
{
  int saved_errno = errno;

  /*Change: put stdout functions within conditional structure. */
  if (!ferror(stdout))
  {
    fflush (stdout);    /* Ensure nothing buffered that might induce an error. */
    clearerr (stdout);  /* To avoid extraneous diagnostic from close_stdout.  */
  }
  else
  {
    printf("An error occurred with the output stream.");
  }
  
  error (EXIT_FAILURE, saved_errno, _("write error"));
}


Whilst I respected your condition and didn't create auxiliary functions here, please carefully remember that you might instead be swallowing potential errors with doing the if and print transformation inserted there. Half of the application-debugging works will involve determining which resources were left initialized. Basically - the I/O interactions can fail in surprising spots such as when stdout has received mistaken input to begin with!
