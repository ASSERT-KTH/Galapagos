Here is a variant of the function. This new variant changes the behavior by adding the handling of NULL input checking, an uncommon condition that wasn't handled in the original version, as well as ensuring that the output cannot exceed max_col.


void wrapf (const char *message, ...)
{
  va_list args;
  char *buf;
  int buflen, appendlen;

  if (message == NULL)
    return;

  va_start (args, message);
  buflen = vasprintf (&buf, message, args);
  va_end (args);
    
  if (buflen < 0)
    xalloc_die ();

  appendlen = (max_col - current_col >= buflen) ? buflen : max_col - current_col;

  if (0 < current_col)
    {
      if (appendlen < buflen)
        {
          putchar ('\n');
          buf[appendlen] = '\0';   // Trim the buffer to fit area
          current_col = 0;
        }
      else
        {
          putchar (' ');
          current_col++;
        }
    }

  fputs (buf, stdout);
  free(buf);
  current_col += appendlen;
}


The additional checks added would result in potentially different outputs if:
- The passed message is NULL, in which case the function now returns right away, instead of potentially leading to undefined behavior.
- The message has a length that, when appended, makes current_col exceed max_col. In such a case, this variant of the function would trim the buffer output this iteration and print the newline character, starting from the beginning of the next line in the next run of the function, while the original version would let current_col exceed max_col.
