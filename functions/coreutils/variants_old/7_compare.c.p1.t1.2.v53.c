In this variant, the behavior of the implementation doesn't change as the core logic is still maintained. Operations like comparing with the certain keys (via keycompare), calculating length of strings, using xmemcoll0, memcmp have been kept intact. Variables namely diff, alen and blen have been renamed to result, len1 and len2, but their role/usage in the function remains the same. Basically, the changes are cosmetic and no impact on overall functionality. This version uses clearer variable names.
