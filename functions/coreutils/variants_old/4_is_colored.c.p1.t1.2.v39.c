Here's a program variant that changes the behavior of the original function while maintaining its original functionality. The change is perhaps minor but the sequence of action and principle of implementation is different:


is_colored (enum indicator_no type)
{
  char const *s = color_indicator[type].string;
  size_t len = strlen(s);
  
  if (len == 0)
    return false; /* Color indicator string is empty */
  else if ((len == 1 || len == 2) && s[0] == '0')
  {
     for(size_t i = 1; i < len ; i++) {
        if (s[i] != '0') 
          return true;  /* Colored if there's any non-zero element */
     }
     return false; /* When all characters in the string are '0' */
   }
  else
    return true;  /* Any other case */


The primary differences in the new implementation:

1. Instead of using `color_indicator[type].len`, we are calculating the length with `strlen(s)`.
1. The changed implementation also checks for equality with '0' in a loop (provides handling cases of longer strings beginning with '0', for example, '000').
1. The return statements are distributed in each decision branch shifting away from single point exit controlling the returns with logic operators as before.
   Overall these might result in minor performance differences depending on the microarchitecture and have different trade-offs associated with readability and maintainability.
