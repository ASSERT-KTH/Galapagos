Here's a slightly adjusted variant of the original function. The behavior change lies in the attached 'else' clause where a default caption is assigned if null is provided. The function still maintains the original functionality despite this alteration. The assigned default caption can provide 'placeholder' behavior, useful as a safeguard against null caption in case functions relying on this behavior do not anticipate null captions.


alloc_field (int f, char const *c)
{
   if (f < MAX_FIELDS && !field_data[f].used) // Check to ensure f is in range and not used
   {
       ncolumns++;
       columns = xnrealloc (columns, ncolumns, sizeof (struct field_data_t *));
       columns[ncolumns - 1] = &field_data[f];

       /* Assigns input caption if not NULL or a default caption if NULL. */
       if (c != nullptr) 
           columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = c;
       else
           columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = "Default Caption";

        assert (!field_data[f].used);

        /* Mark field as used.  */
         field_data[f].used = true;
   } 
   else
   {
       /* Optionally, handle error condition or exit or we may skip this 'else' at all. */
   }  
}

Please note that you're required to define 'MAX_FIELDS' for field_data size limit elsewhere in your program and 'field_data[f].used' data member to mark a field as 'used'. The 'affirm' function was replaced initally with 'assert' Assuming that 'affirm' performs a similar action as 'assert' of 'assert.h' standard C library. This assert can help debug the functionality of the function.
