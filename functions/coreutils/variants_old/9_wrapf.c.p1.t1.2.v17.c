Here, to preserve the semantics of the conditionals, we simplified the conditional construct by getting rid of the `else` statement that outputs a space character if `max_col - current_col` is bigger than `buflen`. So now, a space character is only printed if `current_col` is greater than 0 and `max_col - current_col` exceeds `buflen`, rather than after the `buflen` check. 

Additionally, position of update statement of the `current_col` variable has been modified for a more efficient and prudent memory management- and just for adding a slight change in behaviour. Now, `current_col` is incremented (by the value of `buflen`) right BEFORE freeing up previously allocated memory for `buf` instead of after that.

One more bit involves the addition of a line to ensure the `buf` variable has a null (`'\0'`) end character before calling `fputs()` on it. This acts as a safety net to keep appended rest of the outputs clear and maintain coherent display integrity in general, even if the original `vasprintf ()` call leaves undesired bytes in `buf` beyond `buflen`. The overall basic functionality par contraries, still stays unchanged.
