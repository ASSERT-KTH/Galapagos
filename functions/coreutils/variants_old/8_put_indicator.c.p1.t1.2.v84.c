In this variant, we use a static boolean variable `initialized` to check if the initialization code has been run before. With this variant, the initialization code will only run the first time `put_indicator` is called. This changes the behavior of the original function by introducing state that persists between function calls, but maintains the original functionality under the assumption that `put_indicator` is only called once.
  
The `fwrite` line will execute regardless of the `initialized` variable, ensuring the function's original purpose of writing `ind->string` is still carried out. By not using `! used_color` but a separate variable, we're keeping the possibility of setting `used_color` for its eventual original purpose.
  
Please note that this variant's efficiency and feasibility really depend on broader code conditions. If `put_indicator` needs to execute the block ("used_color" setting through "prep_non_filename_text()") for every new caller running in its own process scope, our change won't apply properly.
