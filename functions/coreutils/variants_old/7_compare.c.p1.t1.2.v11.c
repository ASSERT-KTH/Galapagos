The new variant of the function named compare. 


int compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
    size_t alen, blen;
    int diff;

    if (keylist != NULL) {
        diff = keycompare(a, b);
        if (diff != 0 || unique != 0 || stable != 0) return diff;
    }

    alen = a->length - 1;
    blen = b->length - 1;

    if (alen == 0) {
        diff = blen ? -1: 0;
    } else if (blen == 0) {
        diff = alen ? 1: 0;
    } else if (hard_LC_COLLATE) {
        diff = xmemcoll0(a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
    } else {
        size_t min_length = alen < blen ? alen : blen;
        diff = memcmp(a->text, b->text, min_length);
        
        if (diff == 0) {
          if (alen > blen) diff = 1;
          else if (alen < blen) diff = -1;
        }
    }

    return diff_reversed(diff, reverse);
}

This new variant maintains the same functionality as the original. This revised code includes clearer use of ternary and conditional operators, offering improved readability when following logical flow. However, its behaviour is unchanged, maintaining respect for the keys specified, the required comparison modes, proper handling of text lines, as well as adherence to details like the collation order specified by 'hard_LC_COLLATE' within the same function compactness.
