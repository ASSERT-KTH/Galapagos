Here a variant code is implemented by removing some comments and initializing the variables "diff","alen" and "blen" inline:


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b) {
  int diff = 0;
  size_t alen = a->length - 1; 
  size_t blen = b->length - 1;

  if (keylist) {
    diff = keycompare (a, b);
    if (diff || unique || stable) {
      return diff;
    }
  }
    
  if (alen == 0) {
    diff = - NONZERO (blen);
  } else if (blen == 0) {
    diff = 1;
  } else if (hard_LC_COLLATE) {
    diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
  } else {
    diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));
     if (!diff) {
      diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
     }
  }
   
  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}

Rearranging and removing the comments do not interfere with the functionality of the function.
Remember, the variables and functions such as "reverse", "unique", "NONZERO", "stable","MIN","hard_LC_COLLATE","keycompare", "diff_reversed", "xmemcoll0" which aren't defined within the function are treated as global variables and functions. They should already be defined somewhere globally in the original program or they should be standard built-in variables or functions.
