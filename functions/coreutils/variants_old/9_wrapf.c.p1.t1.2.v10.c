Sure, here's a variant of the code that enforces some operations on the values:


wrapf (char const *message,...)
{
  va_list args;
  char *buf;
  int buflen, current_departure;

  va_start (args, message);
  buflen = vasprintf (&buf, message, args);
  va_end (args);

  if (buflen < 0)
    exit (EXIT_FAILURE);

  current_departure = current_col;

  if (current_departure > 0)
    {
      if ((max_col - current_departure) < buflen)
        {
          putchar ('\n');
          current_departure = 0;
        }
      else
        {
          putchar (' ');
          current_departure++;
        }
    }

  fputs (buf, stdout);
  current_col = current_departure + buflen;
  free (buf);
}


This minor changes apply an alternative approach on which the wrapf function uses local variable `current_departure` instead of referencing `current_col` directly everytime. So that `current_col ++` increments `current_departure`. Thus keeping `current_col` unaffected in case the statement under the `else` condition is not executed.

Also, `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)` has taken over `xalloc_die()`, when `buflen < 0`, as it maintains same original functionality but changes behavior but still exits the program.

Additionally, an execution of `current_col` occurs once after every call to `fputs()` where an addition operation of `current_col` and `buflen` goes once in a `current_departure` local variable, and then assign it to `current_col`.

This updated approach retains the original functionality while slightly changing the behavior. Hence, an updated variant with efficiency.
Remember that swap for `currentColor` and `current_departure`, `xalloc_die()` or `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)`, all are metrics oriented vary which makes code more readable performance oriented and behaves a bit differently .
