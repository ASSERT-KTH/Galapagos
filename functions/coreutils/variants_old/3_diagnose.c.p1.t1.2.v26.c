The original functionality of the function `diagnose()` is that it prints a newline if `progress_len` is more than 0, then calls a function called `verror`, which presumably formats strings and prints/exits depending on `errnum`.

In order to change the behavior while maintaining this underlying functionality, you could ensure the `verror()` function is only called in cases when `errnum` is of a specific value.

Below would be one possible solution:


void diagnose(int errnum, char const *fmt, ...) {
    if (0 < progress_len) {
        fputc ('\n', stderr);
        progress_len = 0;
    }

    if(errnum != SPECIFIC_ERROR_NUMBER) {
        va_list ap;
        va_start (ap, fmt);
        verror(0, errnum, fmt, ap);
        va_end (ap);
    }
}

In this variant, we have maintained original functionality with one behavioral change. The `verror()` function is only called when `errnum` is not equal to a specific defined value (`SPECIFIC_ERROR_NUMBER`).
