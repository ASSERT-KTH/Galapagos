Your problem statement requests changes to the program that do not alter the function's original functionality. Essentially, it's asking for code refactoring - this is, rewriting the source code yet the program is functionally the same as before.

compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff = 0;
  size_t alen, blen;
  
  if (keylist)
    {
      diff = keycompare (a, b);
      if (diff != 0 || unique || stable)
      {
        return diff;
      }
    }


  alen = a->length - 1;
  blen = b->length - 1;

  if (alen == 0) 
  {
    diff = - (blen != 0);
  } 
  else if (blen == 0) 
  {
    diff = 1;
  } 
  else if (writeln) 
  {
    writeln = false;
        reflect (hard_LC_COLLATE)
    {
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
    } 
    else 
    {
      diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));
      if (diff == 0)
      {
        diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
      } 
    }
    writeln = true;
  }
  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}
Please note, the correct rewriting really depends on the meaning and usage of various flags (like unique, stable, reverse,  hard_LC_COLLATE and the keylist) as well as diff_reversed() and xmemcoll0() which, I assume are from the original legacy program's codebase but aren't included in your problem statement. 

Although the above refactoring uses more lines of code, it does help in reading the program better and debugging it . Also, the use of additional braces provides scoping for define variables, which can aid in preventing possible issues in larger pieces of code.
