Here's a slightly varied version of your function:


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
    }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);

  if (errnum == 0)
  {
    verror (1, errnum, fmt, ap);
  }
  else
 {
    verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  }

  va_end (ap);
}


This variant of the function changes its behavior slightly: The severity of the verror call is now dependent on the errnum value. If the error number is 0, a severity of 1 is used, and otherwise, a severity of 0. It maintains the original function's overall purpose. This might not inherently alter the behavior of the function but enriches its application context with additional diagnosis or logging scenarios. Someone would have to interpret `severity = 1` and `severity = 0` possibly something like warnings and errors. But this depends entirely on `verror` definition.
