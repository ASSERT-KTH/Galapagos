The function's original functionality is writing an indicator (sequence of characters) to the standard output ('stdout'). Your variant can modify some parts of it, like for example: modifying flags of original function, initializing signals even if they are already initialized. Example:


void put_indicator (const struct bin_str *ind)
{
    if (!used_color)
    {
        used_color = true;  
        signal_init (); /* Initialize signals regardless of terminal situation */

        prep_non_filename_text ();
    }

    ssize_t res = write(STDOUT_FILENO, ind->string, ind->len);
    if(res == -1)
    {
        perror("Error writing to stdout");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    fflush(stdout); /* Added for safety, in case of buffer flush issues */
}


In this variant:
- The fwrite() call is replaced by the write() system function to write to the standard output. A fflush() has been added right after the write, forcing a flush of the stream 'stdout'.
- Signal instructions have been moved out of the if condition, one will attempt to initialize signals every time function is called, instead of doing it just only once while the output is targeting a terminal.
- Finally, a check function is added for the write() block to handle any possible error during that system's API invocation. If it fails an error message will be shown with perror, and the program will finish with the expected exit code using exit(EXIT_FAILURE). This further establishes resourceful error handling routines.
