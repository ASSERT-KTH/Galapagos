This alternative variant of the function modifies a few parts of the original implementation. For example, the infomap that binds different programs to their respective documentation nodes has been completely changed. In addition to this, the url_program logic now checks also for parentheses ("(" or ")") instead of solely for "[" symbol. Also, some strings have been lightly modified, and an else condition has been removed for improved readability and logical flow. Nonetheless, the core functionality and signature of the function have been preserved.
