Sure! Here's a possible refactoring of the code.
Other changes, such as changing the part with the assignment "alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1" to the form without a comma operator like this one:


alen = a->length - 1; 
blen = b->length - 1;

can deliver more code readability for some developers, but will not change the behavior of the function.


compare(struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
    int diff = 0;
    size_t alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;

    /* Try to compare based on the specified keys firstly (except in cases with no keys) */
    if (keylist)
    {
        diff = keycompare (a, b);
        if(delete_through_to_cmp == 1 || unique || stable) return diff;
    }

    /* In the case of all keys being made equal or not being specified,
       use the default comparison method between a and b */
    diff = (alen == 0 ? - NONZERO (blen) : 
            (blen == 0 ? 1 :
            (hard_LC_COLLATE ? xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1) : 
            (diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen), 
            (!diff ? (alen > blen) - (alen < blen) : diff)))));

    return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}
