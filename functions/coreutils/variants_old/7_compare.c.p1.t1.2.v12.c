Here is a variation of the C code maintaining the original functionality and without changing the function's signature. This version switches the use of nested elif statements with simple ifs to perform checks for `alen` and `blen`, essentially improving the readability and cleans the way program flow is perceived.


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t alen, blen;

  if (keylist)
  {
    diff = keycompare (a, b);
    if (diff || unique || stable)
      return diff;
  }
  
  alen = a->length - 1;
  blen = b->length - 1;

  if (alen == 0 && blen != 0) {
      diff = - NONZERO (blen);
      return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
  }
  
  if (blen == 0 && alen != 0) {
      diff = 1;
      return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
  }

  if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
  {
    diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
  }
  else
  {
    diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));

    if (!diff)
      diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
  }

  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}


This implimentation does not alter the behaviour or the logic of the function. But it does improve readability by replacing chained elseifs with independant if statements, and avoid chaining complex or multi-line else if expression that complicate understanding and can cause troubles with later refactoring. It's important to note that they are not logically equivelent, but it operates equivalently under current use as we're returning the program flow on the `if` checks for `alen` and `blen`.
