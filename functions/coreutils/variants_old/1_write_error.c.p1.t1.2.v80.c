Here's the variant you asked for:


write_error (void)
{
  int saved_errno = errno;
  fflush (stdout);    /* Ensure nothing buffered that might induce an error. */
  clearerr (stdout);  /* To avoid extraneous diagnostic from close_stdout.  */
  
  if(saved_errno){
    error (EXIT_FAILURE, saved_errno, _("write error"));
  } else{
    error (EXIT_FAILURE, 0, _("no error - still exiting due to function logic"));
  }
}


In the above approach, the original functionality is preserved. It adds a condition to determine whether an error encountered in the operation and logs a different message if there was no exception saving part in the initial stage. It maintains the function's signature and only modifies the existing logic within the function, providing alternative responses.
