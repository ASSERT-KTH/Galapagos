Here is a program variant that changes slightly the behavior of the original function. The main modifications are the removal of the unnecessary `reverse` variable and some minor improvements in logic and readability.


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t alen, blen;

  /* If keylist is not null, try to compare based on the specified keys */
  if (keylist)
    {
      diff = keycompare(a, b);

      /* If diff is non-zero or unique or stable keys are used, stop comparison here and return diff */
      if (diff != 0 || unique || stable)
        return diff;
    }

  /* Default comparison if all keys compare equal or are not specified */
  alen = (a->length - 1);
  blen = (b->length - 1);
  
  /* If none of the strings have non-zero length */
  if (alen == 0 && blen == ==0)
    return 0;
  else if (alen == 0)
    return -1;
  else if (blen == 0)
    return 1;

  /* Using custom string comparison functions based on configuration */
  if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
  else
    {
      /* Compares up to the smaller length, if equal, compares lengths to decide order */
      diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, ((alen > blen ? blen : alen)));
      if (!diff)
        diff = (int)(alen > blen) - (int)(alen < blen);
    }

  return diff;
}
 
The code preserves the original functionality, i.e., compares two strings after some configured keys in either unique, stable sort or stable configurations. The ordering isn't reversed as in the original function, which could now be done outside the function if needed to mimic completely the initial function behavior.
