This is the modified code. It uses a ternary operator rather than an if-else statement to alter the behavior, while still maintaining functionality.


nextarg (char const *str)
{
  return (*args == nullptr) ? false : (((args += STREQ (*args, str)), STREQ (*args, str)));
}

This rewritten function behaves similarly to the original function, it still checks if the pointer is null. If it is, it returns false. If it's not, it checks if the current string is equal to the specified string. The boolean result from this function call is incremented to the pointer if true. The same value is then returned.

Note: This code assumes that 'args' is a global or static variable accessible by this function, and STREQ is a macro or function that performs necessary string comparison.

Remember to double-check this variant has the same functionality on some tests, especially for bracing cases. In some situations, more complex ternary operations tend to be harder to understand due to issues related to human perception and may require brackets for proper operator precedence.
