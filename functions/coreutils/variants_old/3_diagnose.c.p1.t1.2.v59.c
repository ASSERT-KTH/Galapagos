Here is one possible solution:


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (0 < progress_len)
  {
    fputc ('\n', stderr);
	progress_len = 0;   
  }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  if(!errnum) {
	  vprintf(fmt, ap);
  }
  else {
	  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  }
  va_end (ap);
}


In this code, weâ€™ve kept the original functionality the same, but the behavior has a slight modification - in the case when `errnum` is zero, we print the format string directly to the standard output instead of printing an error message to `stderr`. This modification could be handy when `errnum` is used as a flag to decide between debug log messages and actual error messages. Reminder: this is one of the many ways you can modify the code whilst retaining the principle of its functionality. You can definitely find numerous other variants with some different behaviors. At the same time, please make sure any variable like `progress_len` and any output or error management functions such as `vprintf`, `verror`, `fputc`, and file descriptors such as `stderr` have been suitably defined and included in the rest of your code (which is not shown here).
