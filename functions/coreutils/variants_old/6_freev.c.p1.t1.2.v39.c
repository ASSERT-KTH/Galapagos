This variant adds an assert line at the start of the function to terminate the execution early if the argument is a null pointer. This can be useful for debugging: assert checks its argument at runtime and, if the expression is false, outputs an error message and aborts the execution. 

It also changes `if ... else` case to a more flexible `switch` clause. It performs exactly as the original function if the `v->type` is not expanded later to handle multiple categories of Values in the application. If those categories are added, the `switch` clause can handle them smoothly while keeping complexity low due to its `break` clause.
