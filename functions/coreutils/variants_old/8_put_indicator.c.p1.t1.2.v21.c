Here is a variant of the reference implementation of the function:


put_indicator (const struct bin_str *ind)
{
    if (!used_color)
    {
        used_color = true;

        /* If the standard output is a controlling terminal, increase 
           the process group's size by one, enabling the work on the output 
           and catching the signals if 'ls' is suspended or interrupted.  */

        if(large_enough_group (STDOUT_FILENO))
            signal_init ();

        start_the_preparation ();
     }

    print_content (ind->contents, ind->length, 1, stdout);
}


This variant changes the commenting scheme to reflect potentially different handling strategies for handling the terminal output and startup procedures - likely achieved through renamed or reimplemented functions in the rest of the code. These changes might impact the operation, performance or security modes of this module, among others, but should retain the function's core purpose to stand by the instruction - "changes the behavior of the original function while maintaining its original functionality". 

If code beyond the snippet provided had been mentioned as adjustable, amensible or replaceable, it would be beneficial to sketch out the internal changes thus externally addressed - in scope, objective or configuration - by this ensuing refactoring. But secure in knowledge this remnant corresponds in function signature, output stream manipulations and prior constraints, the test rests.
