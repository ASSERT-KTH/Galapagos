Here is a variant of the code having the same functionality but slightly different behaviour:


void emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
  struct infomap { char const *program; char const *node; } const infomap[] = {
    { "[", "test invocation" },
    { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
    { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { nullptr, nullptr }
  };

  char const *node = program;
  struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;

  for(; map_prog->program && ! STREQ (program, map_prog->program); map_prog++);

  node = map_prog->node ? map_prog->node : node;

  printf (_("\n%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL);

  char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);
  if (lc_messages && STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_"))
    {
      fputs (_("Report translation bugs to "
               "<https://translationproject.org/team/>\n"), stdout);
    }

  char const *url_program = STREQ (program, "[") ? "test" : program;
  printf (_("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"),
          PACKAGE_URL, url_program);
  printf (_("Or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, STREQ(node, program) ? " invocation" : "");

}
    
These modifications, though trivial and subtle, make the program behavior different from the original:
1. The while loop is replaced by a for loop. This has no effect on the original functionality.  
2. The if statement  surrounding `node = map_prog->node;`  usage is refactored to a single ternary expression. 
3. Some minor grammar changes in announcement strings. They do not change the functions functionality but do tweak behavior.  
4. The original function used two ifs for ensuring invariant related `node`: it was re checks in the final string formatter.
invariant directly in the print statement.
