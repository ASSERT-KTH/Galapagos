Your question is asking for a variation of your provided C code that should change its behavior while keeping its original functionality the same as before. Here's one possibility that you can try.


#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void write_error (void)
{
  /* Save the current errno */
  int saved_errno = errno;
  
  /* Explicitly set the "errno" to 0 */
  errno = 0;

  /* Try to flush stdout */
  if (fflush(stdout) != 0)
  {
    /* If an error occurred, restore the original errno */
    errno = saved_errno;
  }

  /* Clear any existing errors */
  clearerr(stdout);

  /* If the saved errno is a positive number, report error */
  if (saved_errno)
      error(EXIT_FAILURE, saved_errno, "write error");
}

The basic functionality of the function is preserved and we are still dealing with the file; the error is only reported if there's a meaningful `errno` value. This version makes explicit how `errno` is managed and manipulated, helping to ensure correct error handling and making the code more comprehensive. Please remember that this is only a speculative result; the optimal outcome might be different depending on specific aspects of your task or objective.
