The following program variant maintains the functionality but changes the behavior by adding console logs for ease of debugging:


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <error.h>

extern int progress_len;

void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      printf("Start of diagnose function \n"); //console log added
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
      printf("End of condition \n"); //console log added
    }
  
  va_list ap;  
  printf("Initialisation of va_list \n"); //console log added
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
  printf("End of diagnose function \n"); //console log added
}


The newly added console log messages can be helpful during the debugging process. Even after adding the new lines of code the original functionality of the diagnose function has been preserved. At run-time if "progress_len" is greater than zero then a newline is placed and "progress_len" is set to zero. Then it generates a descriptive error message using "errnum", "fmt", and "ap".
