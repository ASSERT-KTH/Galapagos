Sure, I can change the structure and ordering of the code, but the underneath functionality remains the same :

compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t alen, blen;
  
  alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1; 

  if (!keylist) 
  {
    if (alen == 0)
      diff = - NONZERO (blen);
    else if (blen == 0)
      diff = 1;
    else if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
    else
    {
      diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));
      if (!diff)
        diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
    }
  }
  else  
  {
      diff = keycompare (a, b);
      if (diff == 0 && !unique && !stable)
      {
        if (alen == 0)
          diff = - NONZERO (blen);
        else if (blen == 0)
          diff = 1;
        else if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
          diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
        else
        {
          diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));
          if (!diff)
            diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
        }
      }
  }

  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}

In the above variant, alen, blen are calculated at the start of the function, not at the middle. Then, based on whether keylist is 'null' or 'non-null', we branch out and take the respective actions. Breaking the handling clause of keycompare result when diff=0 to a separate encapsulated block inside the else may increase readability as it makes explicit that it handles a specific case from keycompare result while still executes the rest of the logic (handling alen, blen and hard_LC_COLLATE).
