Based on your request and constraints, I can only modify the function's internal programming logic but maintain the primary feature. Primarily the implementation will apply color coding to the output text and then write it on the stdout. One approach to applying color could be like this:


void put_indicator(const struct bin_str *ind) {
    if (!used_color) {
        used_color = true;
        
        /* If the standard output is a controlling terminal, be cautious 
           around signals, so that the colors can return to the base state if "ls" 
           is interrupted or suspended.  */
          
        if (0 <= tcgetpgrp(STDOUT_FILENO))
            signal_init();
           
        prep_non_filename_text();
    }
      
    /* Before, color wasn't applied to the final writing. Let's modify
       that, firstly prep_filename will encompass the text with the specific color codes. */
       
    char *colorized_text = prep_filename(ind->string, ind->len);
      
    fwrite(colorized_text, ind->len, 1, stdout);
                                     
    /* Now we flush stdout to ensure the text will appear immediately on the terminal. */
     
    fflush(stdout);
}


Keep in mind that prep_filename should wrap the passed string between the appropriate color coding escapes based on the context; ANSI codes could apply to this case. The function hasn't been implemented here because of the specification constraints enforcing not creating helper functions. If you'd decide to add helper functions eventually, utility ones could be implemented which would serve in many different contexts as well.

Also, the implementation is reaching for external variables or functions (`used_color`, `STDOUT_FILENO`, `signal_init()`, `prep_non_filename_text()` etc.), although its not made explicit through the function's argument signature or involvement inside an object-oriented implementation. Make sure they're available with correct access rights and calling conventions in your model's wider context!
