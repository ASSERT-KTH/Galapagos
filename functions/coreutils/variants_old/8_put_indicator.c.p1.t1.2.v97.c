Certainly, here is an alternative function keeping everything like functionality, signature in place:


void put_indicator (const struct bin_str *ind)
{
    static bool has_init = false; /* Whether signal has been initialized. */

    if (!used_color)
    {
        used_color = true;
        
        if (!has_init && tcgetpgrp (STDOUT_FILENO) >= 0)
        { 
            /* Execute signal initialization only once. */
           signal_init();
           has_init = true;
        }

        prep_non_filename_text ();
    }

    fwrite (ind->string, ind->len, 1, stdout);
}


The major difference is the choice of executing `signal_init()` only once. Unlike the original function executing `signal_init()` potentially multiple times if `used_color` is consistently being initialized to false out of the function scope, this alternative variant ensures that it happens only once by introducing a static `has_init` variable. This might be more efficient if `signal_init()` is costly and doesn't have side effect being executed multiple times while the color enable state (`used_color`) is a transient state. Other functionalities should be the same as the original variant.
