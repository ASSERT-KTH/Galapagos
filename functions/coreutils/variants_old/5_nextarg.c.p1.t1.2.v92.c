Here is an alternative version of the `nextarg` function that maintains its original functionality:


bool nextarg (char const *str) {
  if (!*args)
    return false;
  
  bool match = STREQ (*args, str);
  
  if (match)
    args++;
  
  return match;
}


This version maintains the original functionality in a slightly modified order. Instead of incrementing `args` in line with the Boolean `r`, it checks if a match has occurred using `if` statement, then increases the adress of `args` according to the match result. Meanwhile, the use of `== nullptr` to check if a pointer is null has been replaced with `!*args` for the version of C Standard/C++ Standard compatibility. A more descriptive variable `match` is given to the resulting status from `STREQ` (string equality function) compared to the variable `r` in the initial version.
