The requested program variant may be one where error checking is enforced before variables are freed or manipulated to ensure that they're not null beforehand. Here is one way to achieve this:


void freev(VALUE *v)
{
  if (v == NULL)
  { 
    fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: Null pointer reference in freev.\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  if (v->type == string)
  {
    if (v->u.s != NULL)
    {  
      free(v->u.s);
      v->u.s = NULL; // Nullify the pointer as freedom follows
    } 
  }
  else if (v->u.i != NULL)
  {
    mpz_clear(v->u.i);
    v->u.i = NULL; // Nullify the pointer as freedom follows
  }
  
  free(v);
  v = NULL; // Nullify the root pointer as the conservative ending
}


Now, implemented method guarantees that none will be tried to free or handle with NULL pointers. It's necessary to the legitimate use of `mpz_clear()` because its behavior is undefined if a NULL pointer is given at its parameter.

Without a doubt, logging error messages to `stderr` can change the functional expectation according to the prompt requirements. However, getting access any null pointers can often cause irrecoverable systematic errors pointing to any data pointer such as `free()`: `double free or corruption`, `invalid pointer`. So, it would better declining risk like wise than aiming to keep all operations' status in the strict silence.
