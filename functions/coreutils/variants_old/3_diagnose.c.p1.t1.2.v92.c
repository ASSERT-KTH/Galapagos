In this revised function, an attempt is made to open a file where the output will be redirected. If it's successful, it writes all outputs to a file named "log.txt" while maintaining the original behavior. Otherwise, the output is sent to the standard error (`stderr`) as was done in the original function. In any case, the original functionality of the function is expected to be preserved: reporting a formatted error message based on arguments passed to it and addressing error number appropriately. However, please note that 'progress_len' needs to be defined in the main code before calling this function or it should be a global variable, so its availability is not affected by the function call.
