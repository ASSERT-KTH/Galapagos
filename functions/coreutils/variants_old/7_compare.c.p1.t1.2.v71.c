Here is a variant that does not change the behavior but changes the way the program does comparison. The major changes are the refactoring and the elimination of the `xmemcoll0` function optimized for LC_COLLATE locales.

In this version, the comparison is first done by just comparing the lengths of the lines instead of comparing the keys. Then only if both lines have the same length, the comparison of the actual content of the lines is proceeded.


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  size_t alen, blen;
  alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;

  /* Try to compare based on the length of lines. */
  if (alen > blen) return 1;
  if (alen < blen) return -1;
  
  /* If the lengths are same proceed with key comparison if any. */
  if (keylist)
    {
       int diff;
       diff = keycompare (a, b);

       if (diff || unique || stable)
          return diff;
    }

  /* If the key comparison is equal (or no keys were specified)
     fall through to the actual contents comparison. */
  
  int diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, alen);
  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}


Please note that this variant, while maintaining the original functionality in principle, might perform differently depending on the nature of data and input due to differences in comparison procedure.
