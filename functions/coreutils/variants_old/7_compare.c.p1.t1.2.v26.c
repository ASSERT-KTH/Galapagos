The logic and functionality remains consistent with the original, while the intermediate steps and code implementation details fluidly communicate and capture the same set of requirements. The revamped function adds an additional layer of directness and readability, especially by incorporating the C ternary operator construct in critical areas and filtering redundant guard clauses.
