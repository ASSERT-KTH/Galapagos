The following variant keeps the original functionality of the `wrapf` function while altering its control flow. This does not make essential changes and preserves the use of all original variables and values. 
This version takes care of the buffer allocation error before managing the margin, providing perhaps a slight increase in performance by not performing unnecessary operations in the event of an error. In situations with `buflen < 0`, it still calls the `xalloc_die()` function as intended.


void wrapf (char const *message,...)
{
  va_list args;
  char *buf;
  int buflen;

  va_start (args, message);
  buflen = vasprintf (&buf, message, args);
  va_end (args);

  if (buflen < 0)
    xalloc_die ();
    
  if (current_col > 0 && max_col - current_col <= buflen) 
  {
      putchar ('\n');
      current_col = 0;
  }  
  else if (current_col > 0) 
  {
      putchar (' ');
      ++current_col;
  }

  fputs (buf, stdout);
  free (buf);

  current_col += buflen;
}


In this variant, the check for output becomes a simple if condition before printing, avoiding redundant checking. Note that we've still maintained the putchar part as per the original logic. It's added depending upon the current column and maximum column. A small tweak to increment is also made - `++current_col` instead of `current_col++` since, in C and C++ scenarios, prefix increment can be more efficient than postfix when the object is a complex type.
