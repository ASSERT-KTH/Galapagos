Here is a variant of the program which maintains its original functionality while changing its behavior. This version checks whether `errnum` and `fmt` are both valid before it starts processing.


void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...) 
{
  if (fmt == NULL || errnum < 0) 
  {
    return;
  }

  if (0 < progress_len)
  {
    fputc ('\n', stderr);
    progress_len = 0;
  }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}

In this variant, before the function processes the variadic arguments, it ensures `fmt` isn't a null pointer and `errnum` isn't a negative number. This provides a preliminary basic form of error checking. The rest of the function remains identical to the original.
