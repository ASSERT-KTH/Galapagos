Sure, a simple change in behavior could be changing the order of functions executed while keeping its functionality same. It could look something like this:


write_error (void)
{
  int saved_errno = errno;
  error (EXIT_FAILURE, saved_errno, _("write error"));   
  fflush (stdout);    /* Ensure nothing buffered that might induce an error. */
  clearerr (stdout);  /* To avoid extraneous diagnostic from close_stdout. */
}
