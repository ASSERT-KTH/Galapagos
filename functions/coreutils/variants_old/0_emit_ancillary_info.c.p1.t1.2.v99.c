Here's an example of a variant that changes the behavior of the original function by outputting to a selectable stream (like stderr) rather than always to stdout:


  void emit_ancillary_info_to_stream(char const *program, FILE *stream)
  {
    struct infomap { char const *program; char const *node; } const infomap[] = {
      { "[", "test invocation" },
      { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
      { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
      { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities" },
      { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities" },
      { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities" },
      { nullptr, nullptr }
    };

    char const *node = program;
    struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;

    while (map_prog->program && ! STREQ (program, map_prog->program))
      map_prog++;

    if (map_prog->node)
      node = map_prog->node;

    fprintf (stream, _("\n%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL); 

    char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);
    if (lc_messages && STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_"))
      {
        fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
                 "<https://translationproject.org/team/>\n"), stream);
      }
 
    char const *url_program = STREQ (program, "[") ? "test" : program;
    fprintf (stream, _("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"),
            PACKAGE_URL, url_program);
    fprintf (stream, _("or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
            node, node == program ? " invocation" : "");
  }

The changes to the behavior are:
- The function now takes a second `FILE *` parameter for output. 
- All `printf` calls are replaced with `fprintf` calls to write to the given stream.
- `fputs` also uses the specified file stream; this function was not emitting to stderr implicitly, but has been updated to have consistent behavior with the rest of the function 

This variant maintains the original functionality by still being capable of outputting to stdout if `stdout` is provided as the new `stream` parameter. But by allowing the stream to be selected, the function can also output to other destinations like stderr, files, or any other output stream represented by a `FILE *`.
