Here's a rewritten version of the function which maintains the original functionality of the function, it just orders the operations differently, and also adds reference-notation to make it clearer where the entities' properties are coming from:


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t alen, blen;

  alen = a->length - 1; 
  blen = b->length - 1;
  
  if (keylist)
    {
      diff = keycompare (a, b);
    }

  else if (alen == 0)
    {
      diff = - NONZERO (blen);
    }
  else if (blen == 0){
      diff = 1;
    }
  else if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
    {
      /* xmemcoll0 is a performance enhancement as
         it will not unconditionally write '\0' after the
         passed-in buffers, which was seen to give around
         a 3% increase in performance for short lines.  */
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
    }
  else
    {
      diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));
      if (!diff){
          diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
		}    
    }
  if (diff || unique || stable){
      return diff; 
  }
  else
  {
    return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
  }
}

Please note, This solution assumes the change should not affect the functional implementation of the original function hence no significant/block code logic is altered. The changes revolve around refactoring and re-optioning the priority of function checks while still getting proper result.
