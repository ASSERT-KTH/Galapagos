Sure, I'll rephrase the same logic of your function via different code blocks to maintain its functionality. 


compare(struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t lenA, lenB;

  if (keylist) 
  {
    diff = keycompare(a, b);
    if (diff != 0 || stable || unique) 
    {
      return diff;
    }
  }

  lenA = a->length - 1;
  lenB = b->length - 1;

  diff = (lenA == 0) ? - NONZERO(lenB)
        : (lenB == 0) ? 1
        : (hard_LC_COLLATE) ? xmemcoll0(a->text, lenA + 1, b->text, lenB + 1)
        : memcmp(a->text, b->text, MIN(lenA, lenB));

  if (!diff && !hard_LC_COLLATE)
    diff = (lenA - lenB > 0) - (lenA - lenB < 0);

  return diff_reversed(diff, reverse);
}

In this variant, I've chosen to use the conditional operator (`condition ? stmt1 : stmt2`) -- also known as the ternary operator for handling conditions as it results in more compact code. The rest of the functionality remains the same as in original function.
