The below variant of the function maintains the function's original purpose, however, the order of operations in the function have been slightly rearranged, with the 'node' and 'url_program' variables determined simultaneously, and printing for package information and documentation combined into a single printf call.

void emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
    struct infomap { char const *program; char const *node; } const infomap[] = {
    { "[", "test invocation" },
    { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
    { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities" }, 
    { nullptr, nullptr }
    };

    struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;
    while (map_prog->program && ! STREQ (program, map_prog->program))
        map_prog++;

    char const *node = map_prog->node ? map_prog->node : program;
    char const *url_program = STREQ (program, "[") ? "test" : program;

    char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);
    if (lc_messages && STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_"))
    {
      fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
               "<https://translationproject.org/team/>\n"), stdout);
    }

    printf (_("\n%s online help: <%s>\nFull documentation <%s%s>\nor available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
        PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL, PACKAGE_URL, url_program,
        node, node == program ? " invocation" : "");
}
The functionality of the function is still same but the order of computations and output calls are changed. Maintaining functionality in a single compact printf call may enable more efficient string reading and formatting, and potentially saving CPU time based on compiler optimizations. Also mapping 'node' and 'url_program' early on may avoid unnecessary branching later in the function.
