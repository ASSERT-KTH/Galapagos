Since we keep its original functionality, potential changes could affect performance, coding style, error handling, etc. Here's an optimal version of this function, which cleans up the memory release to avoid potential leaks in the xalloc_die handling section, buffer null check, updating the current_col is done in single place to avoid errors in calculations:


wrapf (char const *message,...)
{
  va_list args;
  char *buf = NULL;
  int buflen;

  va_start (args, message);
  buflen = vasprintf (&buf, message, args);
  va_end (args);

  if (buflen < 0 || !buf) 
  {
    if(buf) 
      free(buf);
    xalloc_die ();
  }

  if (0 < current_col)
  {
    if ( (max_col - current_col) <= buflen)
    {
        putchar ('\n');
        current_col = 0;
    }
    else       
        putchar (' ');      
  }

  fputs (buf, stdout);
  current_col += buflen;
  
  free(buf); 
} 


In the proposed version:

-The pointer for the character is explicitly initialized to NULL.
- Try to do free(buf), regardless of whether vasprintf call successful before calling o the termination approach (xalloc_die),
- buf is checked before passing it to `fputs()`. This anticipates platforms where `vasprintf()` accepts a NULL buffer.
- Updating the current space counter (`current_col`) made it more cleaner by writing it only once at the fend after processing.
