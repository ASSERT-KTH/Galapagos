Sure. Here's one possible variant of your function that maintains its original functionality but with minor changes to its behaviour:


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  size_t alen, blen;
  int diff = 0;

  /* handling keys if exists */
  if (keylist) 
  {
      diff = keycompare (a, b);
      if (unique || stable)
        return diff;
  }

  /* key comparison resulted non-zero OR
     no keys specified, so resort to default comparison */
  if(!diff)
  {
    alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;

    if (alen == 0)
      diff = blen ? -1 : 0;
    else if (blen == 0)
      diff = 1;
    else if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
    else
    {
      diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, (alen < blen) ? alen : blen);
      if (!diff)
        diff = (alen > blen) ? 1 : ((alen < blen) ? -1 : 0);
    }
  }

  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}


Behaviour Changes:
1. Removed a redundant comparison (`if(diff)`).
2. Operation `- NONZERO (blen)` change to a condition check `blen ? -1 : 0`.
3. Condition does NOT directly return `diff` when `keycompare (a, b) == 0`. However, as there are no statement inside `if (!diff)` that alters `diff` when `diff == 0`, you get the same result since 0 gets returned in the end.
4. replace function-like macro `MIN (alen, blen)` with a direct condition check `(alen < blen) ? alen : blen` to reduce probable macro dependency.
