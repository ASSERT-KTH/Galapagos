Here's a variant of the original function that maintains its original functionality but adds some behavior: it tests whether the fwrite function has executed successfully and if not, returns an error.


int put_indicator (const struct bin_str *ind)
{
    size_t result;
    if (! used_color)
    {
        used_color = true;

        /* If the standard output is a controlling terminal, watch out
          for signals, so that the colors can be restored to the
          default state if "ls" is suspended or interrupted. */

        if (0 <= tcgetpgrp (STDOUT_FILENO))
          signal_init();

        prep_non_filename_text();
    }

    result = fwrite (ind->string, ind->len, 1, stdout);
    if( result != ind->len ) {
        /* handling of error when fwrite was not successful */
        fprintf(stderr, "fwrite error occurred: ", strerror(errno));
        return -1;
    } 
    return 0;
}


This function, similar to the original, writes block data from the buffer pointed to by “ind->string” to the output stream "stdout" per ind->len block(s) of data.

This change allows for better programming practice where you're not simply blind to any error fclose may have thrown. This also allows quick surface error detection if there are any mistakes during the writing process or simply if the writing process used in broader context is not executing as expected. The original function would have not returned or indicated any such error when could occur. Hence, with the change introduced, it adds robustness to the process. It returns 0 when fwrite execution was successful and -1 when an fwrite error had occurred.
