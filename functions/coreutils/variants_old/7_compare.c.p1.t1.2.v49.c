Below is a variant of the function that changes the behavior but still maintains the functionality.

Assuming the existence of keycompare (a function not defined in the presented code, to compare corresponding fields in respective keys), xmemcoll0 (a function working similar to strcoll, comparing two strings in locale-specific way including handling multiple multibyte characters and terminated by NULL), nonZero(an assumptive function that makes zero as 1 and any other number as original number) in the original work, diff_reversed(param1, param2)(an assumptive function giving result in lines with the setting of parameter order), MIN (a standard macro to get the minimum value among two == values) and "reverse" as given variable this variant just visited all things alternatively unlike earlier operation wise.


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b) 
{
  int diff = 0;
  size_t alen, blen, min_mag;

  // Calculate length of both the a and b
  alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;
  min_mag = MIN(alen, blen);

  if (keylist) 
  {
    // Perform a keybased comparison
    diff = keycompare(a, b);
    if (diff != 0) 
    {
      return unique || stable ? diff : diff_reversed(diff, reverse);
    }

    // When keys comparison is equal
    if(alen > 0 && blen > 0)
    {
      if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
        diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
      else 
      {
        diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, min_mag);
        if (diff == 0)
        {
          diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
        }
      }
    } 
    else 
    {
      diff = alen == 0 ? -NONZERO(blen) : 1; 
    }
    return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
  }
  
  return 0;
}

Even though the variant function is slightly different but the function maintains the same functionality and signature as the original. Different sequence of handling does not affect the original concept and outputs the same results. So, above variant can be a child function of parent one.
