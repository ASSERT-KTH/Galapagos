The below program slightly changes the behavior of the defined function 'nextarg' by directly incrementing 'args' instead of storing its result in a separate variable 'r', but it still retains overall functionality:


nextarg (char const *str)
{
  if (*args == nullptr)
    return false;
  else
    {
      if (STREQ (*args, str)) {
        ++args;
        return true;
      }
      return false;
    }
}

In this program variant, if the contents pointed by 'args' and 'str' are equal, 'args' is directly incremented and 'true' is returned. Else, function returns 'false'. It is, of course, under the assumption that STREQ is intrinsic function behaving like strcmp on comparison, args is a mutable pointer and we implied that incrementing it makes *args point to the next argument. There are variables and functions whose implementation context we're assumed to know or that could be library-dependent, yet they were not stated in question.
