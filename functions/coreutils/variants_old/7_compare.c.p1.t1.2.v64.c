Here's a program variant of the provided function. The behaviour and general structure of the function remain identical to the original. However, small optimizations have been added in a few places such as eliminating redundant code.


int compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff = 0;
  size_t alen = a->length - 1, blen = b->length - 1;

  if (keylist)
  {
    diff = keycompare (a, b);
    if (diff || unique || stable)
      return diff;
  }

  if (!alen || hard_LC_COLLATE)
  {
    if (alen == 0)
      diff = - NONZERO (blen);
    else if (blen == 0)
      diff = 1;
    else
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
  }
  else
  {
    diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN (alen, blen));
    if (!diff)
      diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
  }

  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}


This code eliminates the separate if checks previously present in the original c code for alen and blen for calculating `diff`. It also removes the unnecessary resetting of `alen` and `blen` since they get replaced immediately inversely proportional if `alen = 0, diff = -non_zero(blen)`, or if `blen = 0, diff = 1` or if Hard Local Collate then anyway diff is reset so hence there is no point in resetting `alen, blen`. Similarly, we are only computing `diff = - NONZERO (blen)`, when alen equals zero, again this negates the need for a separate `alen` if equal to 0 check that was in original code.
