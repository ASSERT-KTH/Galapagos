Here, while preserving the function's overall functionality, we could change the behavior subtly by including additional programs in our info map array and alternately using if-else clauses in place of current control structure. See the code below,


void emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
  struct infomap { char const *program; char const *node; } const infomap[] = {
    { "[", "test invocation" },
    { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
    { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities"},
    { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities"},
    { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities"},
    { "md5sum", "md5 utilities" }, // Additional program added
    { nullptr, nullptr }
  };

  char const *node = program;
  struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;
  
  for (; map_prog->program; map_prog++) {
    if (STREQ (program, map_prog->program)) {
        node = map_prog->node;
        break;
    }
  }

  printf (_("\n%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL);

  char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);

  if (lc_messages) {
    if(!STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_"))
      fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
               "<https://translationproject.org/team/>\n"), stdout);
  }

  
  char const *url_program;

  if (STREQ (program, "[")){
     url_program = "test"; 
  } else {
     url_program = program;
  }

  printf (_("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"),
          PACKAGE_URL, url_program);
 
  printf (_("or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, node == program ? " invocation" : "");
}  

This function variant adds "md5sum" as an additional program in the infomap array, and adjusts logic in such a way that 'Report any translation bugs toâ€¦" message is printed out only if LC_MESSAGES are set and not starting with "en_", implying that this message will not be printed out for English locales. It also segregates different situations: when "`[`" is a program [handled inside an if block] and other times [handled inside else block] explicitly rather than ternary operator distinction as in the original function.
