Sure, here is a variation of the code by introducing one condition before `fputc` function:


diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (fmt != NULL)
  {
      if (0 < progress_len)
      {
          fputc ('\n', stderr);
          progress_len = 0;
      }
  }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}

In this alternative version of the function:

The added `if (fmt != NULL)` introduces an additional layer of check. We are checking if `fmt` pointer is not NULL before executing further code within the nested if statement. This enables an additional level of protection, so that we avoid executing certain operations when the provided `fmt` pointer is `NULL`.

This behaviour changes the preceding version because earlier (without the nullity check) it would always execute `fputc` if `progress_len > 0` regardless of whether `fmt` is `NULL` or not. Apart from this enhancement, it still retains all the original functionalities just like the earlier function. So this check strengthens the code, making it safer and more robust.
