Here is a program variant that changes the behavior such that it first checks if the 'program' argument is null. If it is, the function will terminate early, before trying to use the 'program' value in the rest of the code. Besides that, its functionality remains the same as the original version.


void emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
  if (!program)
  {
    return;
  }
  
  struct infomap { char const *program; char const *node; } const infomap[] = {
    { "[", "test invocation" },
    { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
    { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { nullptr, nullptr }
  };

  char const *node = program;
  struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;

  while (map_prog->program && ! STREQ (program, map_prog->program))
    map_prog++;

  if (map_prog->node)
    node = map_prog->node;

  printf (_("\n%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL);

  char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);
  if (lc_messages && STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_"))
    {
      fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
               "<https://translationproject.org/team/>\n"), stdout);
    }

  char const *url_program = STREQ (program, "[") ? "test" : program;
  printf (_("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"),
          PACKAGE_URL, url_program);
  printf (_("or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, node == program ? " invocation" : "");
}


In this revised function, if 'program' is null, the function immediately returns to avoid any potential runtime errors due to null pointer dereference. The rest of the function remains identical to the original.
This revised function continues to accomplish the same goals as the original, but is now proofed against receiving a null pointer as its argument.
