There may be various ways to update or modify the original function preserving its initial functionality. One important concern is to make sure the operation costs by proper error checking or resource handling. Here's one simple approach:


wrapf (char const *message,...)
{
  /* Initialization phase */
  va_list args;
  char *buf;
  int buflen;
  
  /* Text construction phase */
  va_start (args, message);
  buflen = vasprintf (&buf, message, args);
  va_end (args);
  
  /* Resource handling for abnormal conditions */
  if (buflen < 0)
  {
      fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation error\n");
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
  
  /* New Line Insertion at column boundaries */
  if (current_col > 0)
  {
      if ((max_col - current_col) <= buflen)
      {
          putchar ('\n');
          current_col = 0;
      }
      else
      {
          putchar (' ');
          current_col++;
      }
  }
  
  /* Text output Phase */
  fputs (buf, stdout);
  
  /* Freeing resources */
  free(buf);
  
  /* Adjust position counter */
  current_col += (buflen -1);
}

A basic strategy in this function could be called "Early Detection of Abnormal Conditions". Instead of getting the length with `vasprintf` and then, if the length is less than zero, practically shutting down the application, the revamped function has an upgraded method of error handling. 

Slightly smaller operations are made to seem derisory but maximal repetitions may cause a delay in the long run. Such an enhancement is seen in adjusting the print cursor with decremented `buflen` shown in the new function code segment `current_col += (buflen -1);`

The simple message construction logic remains the same which guarantees that the original functionality is maintained. A return policy can add more professional tailoring which refers part of the project it resides or standards abided.
