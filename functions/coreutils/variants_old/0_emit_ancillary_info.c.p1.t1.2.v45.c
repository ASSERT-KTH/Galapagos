The request asks for a program variant that changes the behavior of the given function, but there is no specific indication on what way the behavior should be changed. We cannot directly answer this question. Potential ways to change behavior can mean different things: changing the order of proceedings, changing constants, swapping around logical parts, improving efficiency etc. Depends on the information you would provide, we would have been able to give a meaningful answer or solution. However, assuming you wanted to provide more detail in the footer info to handle scenarios where a program is not found in the infomap, see the code below.
 

void emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
  struct infomap { char const *program; char const *node; } const infomap[] = {
    { "[", "test invocation" },
    { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
    { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { nullptr, nullptr }
  };

  char const *node = program;
  bool program_found = false; // Change here
  struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;

  while (map_prog->program && ! STREQ (program, map_prog->program))
    map_prog++;
  
  if (map_prog->program && map_prog->node) { // Change here
    node = map_prog->node;
    program_found = true;
  }


  printf (_("\n%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL);

  char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);
  if (lc_messages && STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_"))
    {
      fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
               "<https://translationproject.org/team/>\n"), stdout);
    }
  char const *url_program = STREQ (program, "[") ? "test" : program;

  printf (_("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"),
          PACKAGE_URL, url_program);

  printf (_("or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, program_found ? "" : " - Not Found!"); // Change here
}

This version of the function emits a "- Not Found!" message. It alerts! The user that the program they're inquiring about is not in the `infomap` structure. However, considering your limitations and requested adjustments reveal greater clarity would be extremely helpful.
