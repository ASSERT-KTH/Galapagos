The following function illustrates a different implementation of the same functionality as in the description:


int compare(struct line const *a, struct line const *b) {
  size_t alen = a->length - 1;
  size_t blen = b->length - 1;
  int diff = 0;

  // First compare based on keylist if it exists
  if (keylist) {
      if ((diff = keycompare(a, b) != 0) || unique || stable) return diff;
  }

  // If key comparison is identical or non-existent, proceed with default comparison
  if (alen < blen) {
      if ((diff = memcmp(a->text, b->text, alen)) == 0) {
          diff = -1;  
      } 
  } else if (alen > blen) {
      if ((diff = memcmp(a->text, b->text, blen)) == 0) {
          diff = 1;
      }
  } else { 
    // alen == blen
    if(hard_LC_COLLATE) {
      /* Maintain the performance enhancement comment */
      diff = xmemcoll0(a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
    } else {
      diff = memcmp(a->text, b->text, alen);
    }
  }

  return diff_reversed(diff, reverse);
}


Here, the shape of the code has been restructured without affecting the function's actual operation. The restructuring reduces the use of `if` statements and employs brief and clear comparing mechanisms which are indicative than `if, than else if, else if approach` used in the original function. This proves that the structure and readability of the function can be improved without altering its operation.
