Explanation:
The variation maintains the original functionality of the base function. Code has been re-written without using `vasprintf` instead replacing it with similar functionality using `vsnprintf` in combination with `malloc`, and `vsprintf`. There are some systems where `vasprintf` is not implemented, so it's a reasonable change that can make the function more portable.

What this does differently: 

The new `vsnprintf` is first used to calculate the length of the processed string, with the function being ptr is NULL and size arg is zero: no buffer is used, but the function still calculates the resulting string length.

Then `malloc` allocates enough memory to accommodate that proposed string.

The processed string is created by `vsprintf`. Uses `printf("%s", buf)` instead of `fputs` for the writable object in the function. Also `fflush(stdout)` is used to empties the output buffer. Selection of `printf` & `fflush` is mainly cosmetic.

Additional checking for failed allocation with `malloc` is implemented, which would in turn call the error-handling `xalloc_die`; this makes the program more robust. 

Finally it subtracts 1 for the null character (`\0`) terminating the string.
