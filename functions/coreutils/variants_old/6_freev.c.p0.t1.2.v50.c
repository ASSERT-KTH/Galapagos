Variant 1:

void freev (VALUE *v)
{
    if (v != NULL) {
        if (v->type == string)
            free (v->u.s);
        else
            mpz_clear (v->u.i);

        free (v);
        v = NULL;  
    }
}


Variant 2:

void freev (VALUE *v)
{
    if (v == NULL)
        return;

    if (v->type == string) {
        if(v->u.s) {
            free (v->u.s);
            v->u.s = NULL;
       }
    } else {
          mpz_clear (v->u.i);
    }

    free (v);
    v = NULL; 
}


Variant 3:

void freev (VALUE *v)
{
    assert(v != NULL);

    if (v->type == string) {
        free (v->u.s);
        v->u.s = NULL;
    } else {
        mpz_clear (v->u.i);
    }

    free (v);
    v = NULL;
}


In all these variants, additional check has been added for NULL input. This was done primarily, so that function behaves correctly even with NULL input. In case the input is NULL, the function safely exits without performing any cleanups that may lead into Undefined behavior. 

Variant1 sets pointer to NULL after freeing it to avoid dangling pointer. 
Similarly, in Variant2 and Variant3, the dangling pointers are made to point on NULL after freeing memory. 

Note: This does not prevent from double free security issue as the actual variable in the calling function is still pointing to the freed memory area. For that, memory management has to be done in the calling function e.g return the pointer from function as in:


struct VALUE * freev (VALUE *v) {
    ...
    retuurn v;
}
 

and then in the calling function:


ptr = freev(ptr);


But this was not allowed according to the constraints.
