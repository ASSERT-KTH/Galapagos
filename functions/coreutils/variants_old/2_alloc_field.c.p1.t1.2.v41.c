The function as it exists currently updates a global columns array and the global field_data by the given index f based on the input pointer 'c'. The main changes we need are related to error handling to deal with issues that can occur, i.e., out of memory. Additionally, it might be good to ensure that the same index is not tried to be included again by confirming that it is unused before modifying it, in order to consolidate this logic rather than expecting developers to affirm first.

Here's how you could update it:


alloc_field(int f, char const *c) 
{
  /* Ensure field isn't already being used  */
  if (field_data[f].used) {
    return;
  }

  struct field_data_t **temp_columns = xnrealloc(columns, ncolumns + 1, sizeof(struct field_data_t *));
  /* If memory allocation fails, xnrealloc will return NULL. */
  if (temp_columns == NULL) {
    return;
  } 
  else {
    columns = temp_columns;
  }

  ncolumns++;
  columns[ncolumns - 1] = &field_data[f];
  if (c != NULL) {
    columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = c;
  }

  /* Mark field as used.  */
  field_data[f].used = true;
}


Note that performance wise, while there may be some increase in complexity on calling xnrealloc prior to checking if the requested field is being used, it was done so here to increase clarity on the fact that, usage or not, the allocation and growth of `columns` has to occur successfully or there's no point, hence putting it at the beginning and returning early if the memory couldn't be allocated.
