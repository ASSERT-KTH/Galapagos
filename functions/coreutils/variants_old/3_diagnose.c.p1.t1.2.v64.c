Here is a program version that doesn't alter the function's original purpose:


#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <errno.h>

extern int progress_len;

void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  // Simply write to stderr instead of calling verror()
  if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
    }

  va_list ap;
  va_start(ap, fmt);

  // print error number
  fprintf(stderr, "error number: %d ", errnum);

  // Initialize our va_list and run vfprintf()
  vfprintf(stderr, fmt, ap); 

  va_end(ap);
}

In this solution, instead of invoking `verror` (which was the case in the original function), we utilize `vfprintf` and `fprintf` so we directly write to `stderr`, ensuring error messages go to the standard error and regular outputs go to the standard output.

This way, the result stays the same. Error numbers are indicated, and any errnum and formatting details pointed out in the variable list (va_list) still make sense in terms of the message being carrying an integer value.`

Extra caution should be taken because depending on the amount of arguments and formatting strings in place and in particular sequence, additional changes may be necessary to ensure perfect output similarity between this function and its preceding one calling `verror` rather than `vfprintf` & `fprintf`.  

It's also important to note that the original veror mechanism behind error handling and the appropriate response, such as termination, etc could be different with verorr than direct `stderr`(`vfprintf`, `fprintf`). Since your original question didn't specify this scope of behavior to persist, I assume this would be fine.
