Sure, here is a variant avoiding the `vasprintf` function and using `sprintf` instead for a more basic level of internal implementation, but basically having the same functionality:


wrapf (char const *message,...)
{
  va_list args;
  char *buf;
  int buflen, sz = 0;

  va_start(args, message);
  while(message[sz]!= '\0') sz++; // Get string length
  sz++; // for NULL termination 

  buf = malloc(sz * sizeof(char));
  if (buf == NULL)
      xalloc_die ();

  buflen = vsprintf(buf, message, args);
  va_end(args);	

  if (buflen < 0)
    xalloc_die ();

  if (0 < current_col)
    {
      if (max_col - current_col <= buflen)
        {
          putchar ('\n');
          current_col = 0;
        }
      else
        {
          putchar (' ');
          current_col++;
        }
    }

  fputs (buf, stdout);
  free (buf);
  current_col += buflen;
}


Please note however, that sprintf doesn't handle memory allocation itself like vasprintf does, so we manually get the length of "message" variable using a loop and allocate memory accordingly using malloc. If the malloc call is unsuccessful and returns NULL, we force an exit similar to the original. Subsequent `realloc()` calls would be necessary as the allocated memory fills up in the cases where larger sets of variable arguments are expected. It is also crucial that anyone using sprintf blends careful memory management with safe buffer usage to prevent overflows.

Also, this implementation will only perform appropriately for data types compatible with converting to a string as expected from "vsprintf()", if you are considering variable data types, more checks are advisable before the variable argument's iteration.
