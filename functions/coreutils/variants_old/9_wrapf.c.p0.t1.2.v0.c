Below is a variant version of the given function which incorporates a few subtle changes:

wrapf (char const *message,...)
{
  va_list args;
  char *buf;
  int gatherLength;

  va_start (args, message);
  gatherLength = vasprintf (&buf, message, args);
  va_end (args);

  if (gatherLength < 0)
    xalloc_die ();

  if (current_col > 0)
    {
      if ((max_col - current_col) <= gatherLength)
        {
          putchar ('\n');
          current_col = 0;
        }
      else
        {
          putchar ('\t');
          current_col++;
        }
    }

  fprintf (stdout, "%s", buf);
  free (buf);
  current_col += gatherLength;
} 

In this variation:
1) the name of the variable buflen is changed to gatherLength for the sake of better semantic implicature.
2) In the original function, it was checked if "0 < current_col", but now it checks if "current_col > 0". The functionality is similar, just the positions of comparators swapped.
3) Instead of the blank space character (' '), it is now a tab space ('\t') which will be displayed when max_col - current_col is more than gatherLength.
4) fputs (buf, stdout) changed to fprintf (stdout, "%s", buf). This change adds syntactic variability to the code but maintains virtually the same functionality as both send the formatted output to stdout. The fprintf function can help use additional format specifiers if needed in the future updating.
