Assuming that the given original function had issues and is meant to check if a null-terminated string passed as an argument equals to another string called "str". This function should increase a pointer by the boolean result of the string comparison giving the expected possibility to skip one element if they're not equal. But in the initial function "args" was mentioned out of nowhere, so modify it with correct use and error handling. Here is the improved yet, function with the same functionality, but different implementation:


#include <string.h>

bool nextarg (char const **pstr, char const *str)
{
  if (pstr == NULL || *pstr == NULL || str == NULL)
    return false;
  else
  {
    bool r = !strcmp(*pstr, str);
    *pstr += (**pstr != '\0');
    return r;
  }
}


This new function handles exceptions more smoothly, declutters the code and gives something similar to the suggested "original functionality". It returns true when strings are equal and false otherwise. Also, it moves to the next char in the first string if it's not the end of the string after comparison.

Note: When dealing with C language, working directly with pointers could be riskier if it comes to memory leaks, crashes and the overall unpredicted outcome, so safety and exception handling are key important here.
