The below variant maintains the functionality of the original function but alters its behavior by splitting nested conditions into their own blocks, which aids in readability and debugging. I've sprinkled a few inline comments to delineate what each block does.


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)
{
  int diff;
  size_t alen, blen;

  /* checking Keys if available*/
  if (keylist)
    {
      diff = keycompare (a, b);
      if (diff || unique || stable)
        return diff;
    }

  /* Default comparison if keys compare equal or not specified */
  alen = a->length - 1;
  blen = b->length - 1;

  /** Starting Length check on lines
   * we have four sections below.
   * First two sections prioritize shorter strings
   * Third section optimized collation order sort for locales 
   * Last one is fall back to lexicographic memory order, with consideration to length.  **/
  
  // Check if first string is empty
  if (alen == 0)
    {
      diff = - NONZERO (blen);
      return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
    }
  
  // check if sec string is empty
  else if (blen == 0)
    {
      diff = 1;
      return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
    }

  // Check If hard_LC_COLLATE is there go in locale sort.
  else if (hard_LC_COLLATE)
    {
      /* Numinator: xmemcoll0 is a performance booster, avoids unnecessary trailing null */
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
    }
  
  // Standard string length consideration where locale collation issues do not exist.
  else
    {
      diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, MIN(alen, blen));
      // length taken to aid decision if strings are found equal with memcmp.
      if (!diff)
        diff = (alen > blen) - (alen < blen);
    }

  // to reverse the decision s per the flag on by default.
  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);
}


This included changes in the behavior however keeps the same functionality.
