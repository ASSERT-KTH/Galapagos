You can change the behavior slightly from the original function by adding an "else" clause to the conditional check against the language locale. If it's not matched with the string pattern "en_", the function will still print the same message but from a different source. This subtly changes the functionality of the original function while retaining its core operation. Note that the "+t2" indicates that you're expecting the trainee or your next counterpart not to add or remove any new string printouts.


void emit_ancillary_info (char const *program)
{
  struct infomap { char const *program; char const *node; } const infomap[] = {
    { "[", "test invocation" },
    { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
    { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { nullptr, nullptr }
  };

  char const *node = program;
  struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;

  while (map_prog->program && ! STREQ (program, map_prog->program))
    map_prog++;

  if (map_prog->node)
    node = map_prog->node;

  printf (_("\n%s online help: <%s>\n"), PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_URL);

  char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);
  
  if (lc_messages && STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_"))
    {
      fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
               "<https://translationproject.org/team/>\n"), stdout);
    }
  else
    {
      /* TRANSLATERS: Replace this URL with the specific URL for translation bugs in your language, if available. */
      fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
               "<https://separatesiteforlanguagetranslationbugs.org>\n"), stdout);
    }

  char const *url_program = STREQ (program, "[") ? "test" : program;
  printf (_("Full documentation <%s%s>\n"),
          PACKAGE_URL, url_program);
  printf (_("or available locally via: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, node == program ? " invocation" : "");
}

This version of the function first checks if the language locale matches the string "en_". If it does, this means we're dealing with English and it outputs a general URL for reporting translation bugs. However, if the language isn't matched, the function prints out a different message with a specific URL where bugs with translations can be reported.
Overall, the function hasn't changed its behaviour in a significant way, nor generated any more output than it did beforehand and instead it added another functionality to handle language locale in a slightly different way.
