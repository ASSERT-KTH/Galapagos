Below is the modified variant of provided function preserving its original structure, functionality and behaviour. This variation uses ternary operator structure to compare `alen` and `blen` towards the end rather than using multiple lines that deliver the same effect efficiently in terms of vertical space, though has no advantages from a functional programming point of view.  


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b)  
{  
  int diff = 0;
  size_t alen = 0, blen = 0;

  if (keylist != NULL)  
  {  
    diff = keycompare (a, b);
    if (diff != 0 || unique != 0 || stable != 0)  
      return diff;  
  }

  alen = (a -> length) - 1;
  blen = (b -> length) - 1;

  diff = (alen == 0) ? - NONZERO (blen) : ((blen == 0) ? 1 : 0);

  if (diff == 0)
  {
    if (hard_LC_COLLATE != 0)  
    {  
      diff = xmemcoll0 (a -> text, alen + 1, b -> text, blen + 1);  
    }
    else  
    {  
      diff = memcmp (a -> text, b -> text, MIN (alen, blen));

      if (diff == 0)
        diff = ((alen > blen) ? 1 : ((alen < blen) ? -1 : 0));  
    }
  }

  return diff_reversed (diff, reverse);  
}

This variant has embraced a rather compact writing style that doesn't compromise the readability and understandability of the source code content. In all other aspects, the variant fulfills the terms of the task.
