The following program variant changes the behavior of the original function by checking also whether the error number is zero. If it is, it doesn't proceed to print the error.


#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (errnum!=0) // added error number check
  {
      static int progress_len = 0; // Added static keyword
    

      if (0 < progress_len)
      {
          fputc ('\n', stderr);
          progress_len = 0;
      }

      va_list ap;
      va_start (ap, fmt);
      vfprintf(stderr, fmt, ap);  // Substitute verror function
      va_end (ap);
   }
}    


Please note that several changes were made above, which could vary based on your compiler, your allowed libraries, and your particular use case. This version uses `vfprintf` instead of `verror`, `static` was added to `progress_len` (modify accordingly if `progress_len` exists elsewhere externally in your code), and there's now an additional zero error number check.
