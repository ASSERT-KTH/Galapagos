Here is an alternative implementation which performs the exact same comparison but rearranges the checks and logical flow slightly:


compare (struct line const *a, struct line const *b) {
    int diff;
    size_t alen = a->length - 1;
    size_t blen = b->length - 1;

    if (keylist) {
        diff = keycompare (a, b);
        if (diff || unique || stable)
            return diff;
    }

    if (alen == 0 && blen > 0)
        return -1;
    else if (blen == 0)
        return 1;

    if (hard_LC_COLLATE) {
        diff = xmemcoll0 (a->text, alen + 1, b->text, blen + 1);
    } else {
        diff = memcmp (a->text, b->text, (alen < blen) ? alen : blen);
        if (!diff)
            diff = alen > blen ? 1 : alen < blen ? -1 : 0;
    }
    return diff_reversed(diff, reverse);
}


Here the lengths of each line (`alen` and `blen`) are computed early to allow combining checks for zero lengths (`alen == 0`, `blen == 0`) into simpler logic that minimizes the number of branches in the program. The length computation and conditionals have been re-arranged, while preserving the essential functionality from the original reference function.
