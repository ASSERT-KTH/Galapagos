Here is a variant of the original function. This variant makes a check if the provided index 'f' is within the bounds of the 'field_data' array. If 'f' is not within the bounds of the 'field_data' array, it returns without doing anything. This is a way to prevent array out of bounds exception.


void alloc_field (int f, char const *c)
{
  if(f < 0 || f >= field_data_length)
      return;

  ncolumns++;
  columns = (struct field_data_t **) realloc (columns, ncolumns * sizeof (struct field_data_t *));
  if(columns == nullptr)
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      
  columns[ncolumns - 1] = &field_data[f];
  
  if (c != nullptr)
    columns[ncolumns - 1]->caption = c;

  if(field_data[f].used)
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: Field already in use.\n");

  field_data[f].used = true;
}

where, `field_data_length` is the number of elements that 'field_data' can hold. So 'f' should not be less than 0 and not more than or equal to 'field_data_length' for a safe program run.

Please, note that generally modifying a function that way can lead to changes to the program's operation situations where out of range indices are valid due to 'field_data' array being globally accessed and modified. If this function is being used in this way, the variant provided can cause issues where the original would have worked as expected.
