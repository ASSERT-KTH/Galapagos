The variant C code is as follows:


#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <error.h>

extern int progress_len;
void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  if (1 == errnum)
    {
      fputs("Warning: There seems to be an error.\n", stderr);
      if ( 0 < progress_len)
      {
          fputc ('\n', stderr);
          progress_len = 0;
      }
    }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  verror (0, errnum, fmt, ap);
  va_end (ap);
}

The program variant still operates the same as the initial, if the error number is not 1, but with `errnum` equal to 1, it will also output a warning message before executing the main functionality. It does not interfere with its original functionality but slightly changes the behavior under specific conditions. It does not call helper functions, and it maintains the function's signature as required.
