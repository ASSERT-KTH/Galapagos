Here is a variant of the function that alters its behavior slightly by uppercasing the package name and URL when it prints, to ensure they stand out more.

void emit_ancillary_info (char const *program) {
  // no change here
  struct infomap { char const *program; char const *node; } const infomap[] = {
    { "[", "test invocation" },
    { "coreutils", "Multi-call invocation" },
    { "sha224sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha256sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha384sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { "sha512sum", "sha2 utilities" },
    { nullptr, nullptr }
  };

  char const *node = program;
  struct infomap const *map_prog = infomap;

  while (map_prog->program && ! STREQ (program, map_prog->program))
    map_prog++;

  if (map_prog->node)
    node = map_prog->node;

  // updated to output uppercase package name and URL
  printf (_("\n%s ONLINE HELP: <%s>\n"), strupr(PACKAGE_NAME), strupr(PACKAGE_URL));

  // no changes here
  char const *lc_messages = setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, nullptr);
  if (lc_messages && STRNCMP_LIT (lc_messages, "en_")) {
      fputs (_("Report any translation bugs to "
               "<https://translationproject.org/team/>\n"), stdout);
    }

  char const *url_program = STREQ (program, "[") ? "test" : program;
  // updated to output uppercase package URL
  printf (_("FULL DOCUMENTATION <%s%s>\n"),
          strupr(PACKAGE_URL), url_program);
  printf (_("...or available locally qualified: info '(coreutils) %s%s'\n"),
          node, node == program ? " invocation" : "");
}

Please note, strupr may lead to some undefined behavior if PACKAGE_NAME or PACKAGE_URL are constant char pointers. This is because it mutates the original data making it uppercased. If youâ€™re not the one managing that original data and this manipulation is risky from your point of view, then you should perform the conversion on a copy of the string using temporary buffers.

One possible solution would bypass the modification of constant variables following this procedure: create temporary buffers, copy into them the PACKAGE_URL and PACKAGE_NAME data, then proceed with uppercase conversion and printing them.
