Below is a variation of the original function that includes an additional conditional statement for handling errnum = -1 differently. In this case, instead of calling verror(), it will print a custom error message. Otherwise, the function acts as the original function.


#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void diagnose (int errnum, char const *fmt, ...)
{
  static int progress_len = 0;

  if (0 < progress_len)
    {
      fputc ('\n', stderr);
      progress_len = 0;
    }

  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, fmt);
  if (errnum == -1)
  {
    fprintf(stderr, "Custom error: ");
    vfprintf(stderr, fmt, ap);
    fprintf(stderr, "\n");
  }
  else
  {
    vprintf(fmt, ap);
  }
  va_end (ap);
}

Please note that the function verror() is not a standard C function, so it was replaced with vprintf() which performs a functionality similar to what can be expected to be performed by the made up verror() function. This program will print the given message to the standard output for all error codes except -1, where it will print to the standard error output and prefix the message with "Custom error: ". As required, it still respects the function's signature.
