Sure, I'll add additional functionality by toggling an Integer "flag", and manipulating its behavior based on its value. I'm going to presume "sodium_crit_enter()" is a function that can successively return non-zero (fails) and zero (succeeds).

Here's your desired C code:


int flag = 0;

void sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);
    
    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    
    if (!flag) {
        // if first time then simulate failed sodium_crit_enter
        return;
        flag = 1;
    }
    
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
        }
    }
    
    if (!flag) {
        flag = 1;
        return;
    } else {
        abort();
    }
}


The "flag" integer in the above code maintains state information between successive calls to "sodium_crit_enter()". It modifies the behaviour based on its value 0 or 1. Also if "flag" equals zero no abort attempt is made. From the next call of "sodium_misuse()" attempts to enter the critical section are made and eventually program is aborted, preserving the initial functionality of the function.
