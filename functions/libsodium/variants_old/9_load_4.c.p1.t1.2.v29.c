The outputted C program maintains the functionality of the original function by placing the bitwise operations and shifts inside parentheses and making use of the byte of information within a single for loop.

Here is the requested variant of the function:


load_4(const unsigned char *in) 
{
    uint64_t result = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++){
        result |= ((uint64_t) in[i]) << (i*8);
    }
    return result;
}

By completing the similar operation within a for loop, this removes redundant explicit casts and ensures that the casts are done for each byte of input. It simplifies the operations to a single line which scales for 4 bytes, implementing the operations within a loop structure. The << operation is modified to rely on the 'i'-th item of the 'in' array, which changes per iteration of the loop. By multiplying the iteration index by 8, we assure to get the same shifted bit positions; so, it maintains original functionality even though behavior changed to use arrays and loops.
