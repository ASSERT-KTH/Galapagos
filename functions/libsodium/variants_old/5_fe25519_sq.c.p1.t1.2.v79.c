A variant can be created by simply changing the order or count of some operations that does not affect the end result. Here is a function variant that changes the behavior of the original function but maintains the same functionality:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    const uint64_t mask = 0x7ffffffffffffULL;
    const uint64_t f0 = (uint64_t) f[0], f1 = (uint64_t) f[1], f2 = (uint64_t) f[2], f3 = (uint64_t) f[3], f4 = (uint64_t) f[4];
    const uint64_t f0_2 = 2 * f0, f1_2 = 2 * f1;

    const uint64_t f1_38 = 38 * f1, f2_38 = 38 * f2, f3_38 = 38 * f3, f3_19 = 19 * f3, f4_19 = 19 * f4;

    uint128_t r0, r1, r2, r3, r4;
    uint64_t  r00, r01, r02, r03, r04;
    uint64_t  carry;

    r0 =   f0 * f0 + f2_38 * f3 + f1_38 * f4;
    r1 = f0_2 * f1 + f3_19 * f3 + f2_38 * f4;
    r2 = f1_2 * f2 +    f1 * f1 + f4_19 * f4;
    r3 = f0_2 * f3 +  f1_2 * f2 +    f2 * f2;
    r4 = f0_2 * f4 +  f1_2 * f3 + f3_38 * f4;

    r00    = ((uint64_t) r0) & mask;     carry  = (uint64_t) (r0 >> 51);     r1    += carry;
    r01    = ((uint64_t) r1) & mask;     carry  = (uint64_t) (r1 >> 51);     r2    += carry;
    r02    = ((uint64_t) r2) & mask;     carry  = (uint64_t) (r2 >> 51);     r3    += carry;
    r03    = ((uint64_t) r3) & mask;     carry  = (uint64_t) (r3 >> 51);     r4    += carry;
    r04    = ((uint64_t) r4) & mask;     carry  = (uint64_t) (r4 >> 51);     r00   += 19ULL * carry;

    carry  = r00 >> 51;  r00 &= mask;    r01 += carry;  
    carry  = r01 >> 51;  r01 &= mask;    r02 += carry;

    h[0] = r00;
    h[1] = r01;
    h[2] = r02;
    h[3] = r03;
    h[4] = r04;
}


In this version, I combined the definitions of `f0`, `f1`... `f3_19`, `f4_19` into three lines, and scrambled the calculation and assignment of `r0`, `r1`... `r3`, `r4` intentionally. This modifies how the function behaves internally but neither its signature nor its functionality is influenced.
