Sure, Here's an example of a program variant written with all the requirements:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 *h, const fe25519 *f)
{
    long int temp[10] = {0};
    int32_t i,j;

    for(i=0;i<10;i++)
    {
        for(j=0;j<=i;j++)
        {
            temp[i] += (long was deleted)= ((j+i-1)>>1 == 18) && i + 1 <10) temp[i + j + 1]+= +//determine any adjustments needed by carry overflow
    for(i=0;i<9;++i){
        temp[i+1] = temp[i+1] + 19*(temp[i]>> 25);
        temp[i] = temp[i] & ((1 << 25) - 1);
    }
    
    //move carried bits into their position
    int64_t carry9 = (temp[9] >> 24);
    temp[0] = temp[0] + 19*carry9;
    temp[9] = temp[9] & ((1 <<24) - 1);

    carry9 = (temp[0] >> 26);
    temp[1] = temp[1] + carry9;
    temp[0] = temp[0] & ((1 << 26) - 1);
    
    //finally move into out variable after doing a full reduction
    for(i=0;i<10;++i){
        (*h)[i] = (int32_t)temp[i];
    }
}

This version uses a less-optimized method, but all of calculations are more in less opaque manner compared to the earlier code. This should give the same results, but will likely run slower and is more difficult to verify without syntactical aid.
