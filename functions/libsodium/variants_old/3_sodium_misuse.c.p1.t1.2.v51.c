Just to clarify, the sodium_misuse() function as defined in the provided code answers crypto state machines calls and cleans all outgoing buffers, misuses can happen if crypto checks fails within your existing handler.

Here is a variant function that attempts to illustrate this process:


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void _misuse_handler (void);

void sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();

    while (1) {
        if(sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
            handler = _misuse_handler;

            if (handler != NULL) {
                handler();
                break; // exit loop when an handler is assigned and has been called
            }
        }
    }
    abort();
}


In this variant, if no handler is assigned (_misuse_handler is NULL), the function enters into a loop, continuously attempting to assign a handler (_misuse_handler) and call it. Own sodium_crit_enter nor sodium_crit_leave definitions does not exist in the given requirements, therefore them left as they were in the original peace of code. Please note that infinite loop is a bad design practice so the consequences and proper interrupts or program interrupt conditions should be considered.
