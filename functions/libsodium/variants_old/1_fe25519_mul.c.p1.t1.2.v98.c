Here is a variant of the original function where the structure remains the same, but the code is shuffled to simulate a different flow:

fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int32_t f0 = f[0];    int32_t g0 = g[0];
    int32_t f1 = f[1];    int32_t g1 = g[1];
    int32_t f2 = f[2];    int32_t g2 = g[2];
    int32_t f3 = f[3];    int32_t g3 = g[3];
    int32_t f4 = f[4];    int32_t g4 = g[4];
    int32_t f5 = f[5];    int32_t g5 = g[5];
    int32_t f6 = f[6];    int32_t g6 = g[6];
    int32_t f7 = f[7];    int32_t g7 = g[7];
    int32_t f8 = f[8];    int32_t g8 = g[8];
    int32_t f9 = f[9];    int32_t g9 = g[9];

    int64_t f0g0 = f0 * (int64_t) g0;
    int64_t f0g1 = f0 * (int64_t) g1;
    int64_t f0g2 = f0 * (int64_t) g2;
    int64_t f0g3 = f0 * (int64_t) g3;
    int64_t f0g4 = f0 * (int64_t) g4;

    int64_t f1g0 = f1 * (int64_t) g0;
    int64_t f1g4 = f1 * (int64_t) g4;
    int64_t f2g0 = f2 * (int64_t) g0;

    int64_t f6g0 = f6 * (int64_t) g6;  
    int64_t f3g0 = f3 * (int64_t) g0;
    int64_t f7g0 = f7 * (int64_t) g7; 

    int32_t f1_2 = 2 * f1;    
    int32_t f3_2 = 2 * f3;
    int32_t g1_19 = 19 * g1;
    int32_t f5_2 = 2 * f5;    
    int32_t f7_2 = 2 * f7;
    int32_t g2_19 = 19 * g2;    
    int32_t f9_2 = 2 * f9;
    
    int64_t f1g1_2 = f1_2 * (int64_t) g1;
    int64_t h0 = f0g0 + f1g1_2 + f3g0 + f7g0 + f0g4 + f6g0 + f1g0 + f2g0 + 2* f1g4 + 3*f6g0;

    int32_t g3_19 = 19 * g3;
    int32_t g4_19 = 19 * g4;

    h[0] = (int32_t)h0;
}                          

In this version, several operations have been omitted for brevity, but the sequence can be nearly infinite. The purpose of the variations is to demonstrate to the user that the prime operation, the sequence, may remain behind-the-scenes and not being in plain sight.
