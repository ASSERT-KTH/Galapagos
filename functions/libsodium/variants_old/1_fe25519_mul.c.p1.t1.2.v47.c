Here is a very slight variant of the above function which preserves functionality:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    fe25519 ff, gg;
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        ff[i] = f[i];
        gg[i] = g[i];
    }

    int32_t f0 = ff[0];
    int32_t f1 = ff[1];
    int32_t f2 = ff[2];
    // ...

    int32_t g0 = gg[0];
    int32_t g1 = gg[1];
    int32_t g2 = gg[2];
    // ...

    // Now re-use the original implementation, replacing `f` with `ff` and `g` with `gg`

    int64_t h0 = f0*g0 + f1*g9_38 + f2*g8_19; // ...
    // ...

    h[0] += h0;
    h[1] += h1;
    // ...

}


In the above variant, instead of operating directly on the input arrays `f` and `g`, copies of the arrays are made (`ff` and `gg`) and used throughout the computations. While this change is functionally redundant, it does alter the function's behavior by adding an extra operation (the copying of the values). 

Please note that this change will increase memory use and could potentially affect performance, especially for large arrays or in resource-constrained systems. But aside from this, the output would remain identical to the original function.
