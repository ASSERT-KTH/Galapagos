The given function implementation is for a part of the Ed25519 cryptographic signature system. However, alternative implementations that maintain the same functionality can differ in their specific designs for performance enhancements, platform-specific optimizations, and legibility improvements.

Below is one possible variant of the provided function:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f) {
    const uint64_t mask = 0x7ffffffffffffULL;
    uint128_t r[5], f_2[5], f_38[5];
    uint64_t r0[5], carry, y;

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        f_2[i] = (uint128_t)f[i] << 1;
        f_38[i] = (uint128_t)f[i];
        if (i < 3) f_38[i] *= 38ULL;
        else f_38[i] *= 19ULL;
    }

    r[0] = f_2[0]*f[0] + f_38[1]*f[4] + f_38[2]*f[3];
    r[1] = f_2[0]*f[1] + f_38[2]*f[4] + f_38[3]*f[3];
    r[2] = f_2[0]*f[2] + f[0]*f[0] + f_38[3]*f[4];
    r[3] = f_2[0]*f[3] + f_2[1]*f[2] + f_38[4]*f[4];
    r[4] = f_2[0]*f[4] + f_2[1]*f[3] + f_2[2]*f[2];

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        y = (uint64_t)(r[i]) & mask;
        carry = y >> 51;
        r0[i] = y & mask;
        if (i < 4) r[i+1] += carry;
        else r0[0] += 19 * carry;
    }

    carry = r0[0] >> 51; r0[0] &= mask;
    r0[1] += carry; carry = r0[1] >> 51; r0[1] &= mask;
    r0[2] += carry; r0[2] &= mask;

    for(int i=0; i<5; i++)
    {
        h[i] = r0[i];
    }
}


This function performs the exact same computation but introduces some looping to reduce repeating code and to improve the code's legible symmetry. Note that the correct working of both versions assumes that the y-variables are able to hold a value up to 2^128. If that's not the case, both implementations will fail.
