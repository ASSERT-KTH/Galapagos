The proposed code changes the behavior of the original function while maintaining its original functionality by:

1. Adding some logic inside the if-else statement for failure in sodium_crit_enter function.
2. Needs to call abort function regardless to keep it's original functionality, but with if(1) condition to remove unreachable codes warning from compilers(as some consider abort like exit and do a Warning for any line after it). Adding some redundancy such as the if(1) condition appears to compiler it should not improve runtime operation as compiler optimization will certainly remove it.
4. Using a "volatile" qualifier before declaring the function pointer variable decreases the possibility that compiler optimizations interfere with the desired sequence of code, more specially on embedded systems.
