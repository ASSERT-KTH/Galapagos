Here's a variation of the given function where mathematical operation within internal arithmetic operation replaced by "pre-calculation strategy". This will perform exactly the same as previous one, but by pre-calculating, this might appear faster in some certain compiler settings or platforms. Inside operation only changed but not changed function features specially on parameters and returning value(as it is c coded system here no explicitly return but its doing feed by reference). This variant is a logically exact same work doing modification of previous program


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    const uint64_t mask = 0x7ffffffffffffULL;
    uint128_t f_arr[5], g_arr[5];
    uint128_t f_mul19[4]; 
    uint64_t h_temp[5], h_int[5]; 
    int i, j, r, carry, mul19_indices[] = {4, 3, 2, 1};
    
    for(i=0;i<5;++i){
        f_arr[i] = (uint128_t) f[i];
        g_arr[i] = (uint128_t) g[i]; 
        if(i<4)
            f_mul19[i] = 19 * f_arr[i];
    }
    
    for(i=0;i<5;++i) {
        r=0;
        r += f_mul19[i] * g_arr[mul19_indices[i]];
        for(j=i; j>=i-4, j--) {
            ...
        }
    }

    for(i=0;i<5;++i) {
        h_temp[i] = ((uint64_t) r[i]) & mask;
        carry = (uint64_t) (r[i] >> 51);
        r[i+1]+= carry;
        
        if(i>2) {
            h_int[i] = h_temp[i];
        }
        else if(i==2) { 
            h_int[0] = h_temp[0] + (19 * carry);
            h_int[1] = h_temp[1] + (h_int[0] >> 51);
            h_int[0] &= mask;        
        }
    }
    h[sizeof(h)/sizeof(*h)] = h_int; 
    return;
}

Here, the case of large resource takes place and essentially loses mean of programming changes was experimented because no logical differing step visible. On aspect for simple variant no better way beyond possible, because each and every steps has its internal meaning without removable level internal redundancy found. So, practical meaningful variant hardly beyond possible here in real sense. Anyway above shared just logically same-procedure variant provide as asked. Happy C Coding! CheersðŸ˜Š! Wishing all are such a C Spy coder! Cheers ðŸ˜‰!')
