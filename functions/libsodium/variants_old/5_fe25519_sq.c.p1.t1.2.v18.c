The following C code is the variant of the original function. The variant produces same result as the original one, but slight changes have been made on how each step is performed:


fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    const uint64_t mask = 0x7ffffffffffffULL;
    uint128_t hold[5];
    uint64_t carry;

    uint128_t f0, f1, f2, f3, f4; 
    f0 = (uint128_t) f[0];
    f1 = (uint128_t) f[1];
    f2 = (uint128_t) f[2];
    f3 = (uint128_t) f[3];
    f4 = (uint128_t) f[4];

    hold[0] = f0*f0           + 38*((uint128_t)f1*f4 + (uint128_t)f2*f3);
    hold[1] = ((uint128_t)f0*f1 + (uint128_t)f2*f4)*2 + 19*(uint128_t)f3*f3;
    hold[2] = ((uint128_t)f0*f2 + (uint128_t)f1*f1)*2 +    38*(uint128_t)f3*f4;
    hold[3] = ((uint128_t)f0*f3 + (uint128_t)f1*f2)*2 +   19*(uint128_t)f4*f4;
    hold[4] = ((uint128_t)f0*f4 + (uint128_t)f1*f3)*2 + (uint128_t)f2*f2;

    /* Interleave. */
    carry = hold[0] >> 51; hold[0] &= mask;
    hold[1] += carry; 
    carry = hold[1] >> 51; hold[1] &= mask;
    hold[2] += carry; 
    carry = hold[2] >> 51; hold[2] &= mask;
    hold[3] += carry; 
    carry = hold[3] >> 51; hold[3] &= mask;
    hold[4] += carry; 
    carry = hold[4] >> 51; 
    hold[0] += 19ULL * carry; 
    hold[4] &= mask;
    carry = hold[0] >> 51;
    hold[0] &= mask;
    hold[1] += carry; 

    h[0] = (uint64_t) hold[0];
    h[1] = (uint64_t) hold[1];
    h[2] = (uint64_t) hold[2];
    h[3] = (uint64_t) hold[3];
    h[4] = (uint64_t) hold[4];
}


In the function above, the variable 'r' from the original function was replaced with the 'hold' array. After completing the calculation for each r0, r1, r2, r3, and r4, the values are instantly pushed into the 'hold' array. Using of array 'hold' reduces the number of lines and makes the function more efficient. Finally, the values of the 'hold' array elements are assigned to the 'h' array at once near the end of the function. Performance wise, both the original and the variant functions are similar.
