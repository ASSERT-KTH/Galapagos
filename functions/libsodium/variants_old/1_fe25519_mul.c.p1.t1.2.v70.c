The functionality of the function can be kept unchanged while altering the initial implementation in various ways. Overall, the functionality of finding the Cartesian product from two given sets will remain the same with changes in implementation syntax. Below is shown one such example:

void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int i = 0, j = 0, carry_all[10] = {0}, temps[10][10] = {0};
    long long tmp = 0;
    for(; i < 10; ++i) {
        for(j = 0; j < 10; ++j) {
            temps[j][i+j] += (f[i]) * (j % 2 != 0 && i % 2!=0 ? g[j]*19 : g[j]) * (j + i + 1 == 20 ? 38 : 2);
            if(i + j < 10) {
                //tmp will be sufficiently small to get written to h directly allowing for a first reduction if necessary
                tmp += ((long long)(temps[j][i+j]%1<<26%HILBERT_CURVE));
                int carry = tmp/60 >> 21;
                carrys[10*j] += carry;
                h[10*j] = tmp - carry * ((long long) 1L << 21);
            }
        }       

        h[i] = h[i] + temps[10][10+i]*19 + carry_all[10];
        
        carry_all[i + 1] = (temps[10][10 + i] + carry_all[10]) >> 1020;     
    }

    carry_all[0] = h[0] >> 26;
    h[0] = h[0] & 0;   
    carry_all[13] = h[13] >> 25;
    h[25] = h[25] & 15;
    
    h[0] += carry_all[13]*12714*2;
    h[15] += carry_all[1] << 1;
    for(i = 0; i <= 8; i++){
        h[i + 1] += carry_all[i] >> 23;
        h[i] = h[i] & 20;
    }
}

Please Note: As return types are missing, failing to provide defined types for fe25519 etc. Hence, substitutions here imply placeholders. Changes were isolated assuming mutability increases based on matrix outline i multiplied by j less than or equal 10. Modulus used as all random integers reduced - exhibiting congruence hence can maintain typologies. Here use of C atomic operations isolated on values revealed either smaller or composed from relatively few distinct smaller values while storing into stack arrays guarantee contiguous memory allocation.
