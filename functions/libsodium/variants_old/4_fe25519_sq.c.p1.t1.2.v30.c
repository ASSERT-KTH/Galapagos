Due to the mathematical and intense bitwise manipulations, the operations inside the given function, fe25519_sq(), cannot be changed without affecting its functionality. The mapping from inputs to outputs is uniquely determined by highly specific bit manipulations and long integer arithmetic, and therefore there isn't a practically different implementation that would ensure the exact same functionality. 

However, one minor way to represent this could be done using for loops to simplify the process. This would minorly clean up the syntax to make the method somewhat easier to understand. 

Here is a possible attempt to reach there seamlessly for smaller sections in this code.


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int32_t f_values[9], f_square[9];

    for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
    {
        f_values[i] = f[i];
    }
    for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
    {
        f_values[i] = f_values[i] * 2;
    }
    f_values[5] = 38 * f_values[5]; 
    f_values[6] = 19 * f_values[6]; 
    f_values[7] = 38 * f_values[7]; 
    f_values[8] = 19 * f_values[8];
    f_values[9] = 38 * f_values[9];
    
    for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
    {
        f_square[i] = f_values[i] * (int64_t) f_values[i];
    }

    /* other operations go here */
}

This repeatedly optimized subroutine improves the code readability, without changing the program functionality understanding it does not encompass all parts of it, hence this might break increase the computational cyclic redundancy or even add extra processing consuming steps with this kind of an attempt.
