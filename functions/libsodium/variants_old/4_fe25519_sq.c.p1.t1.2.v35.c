This problem doesn't have a straight answer. It requires an interpretation of what it means to "change the behavior of the original function while maintaining its original functionality." 

If it would suggest improving the code efficiency or code readability without changing the final outcome of the function, we could change some minor details:

1) Use for loop to assign variables instead of direct assignments.

2) Shorten the calculation procedures by creating some repeatable from calculation.

Here is a slightly optimized variant:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int32_t fMultipliedTimes2[9];
    int32_t fNewValues[5];
    
    for(int i = 0; i<9; i++){
        fMultipliedTimes2[i] = 2 * f[i];
    }

    fNewValues[0] = 38 * f[5];
    fNewValues[1] = 19 * f[6]; 
    fNewValues[2] = 38 * f[7]; 
    fNewValues[3] = 19 * f[8]; 
    fNewValues[4] = 38 * f[9];

    int64_t fResult1 = generalEquation(f, fMultipliedTimes2, fNewValues);

    int64_t carry[10];

    for(int i = 0; i<9; i+=4){
        carry[i] = (fResult1[i]  + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
        fResult1[i+1] = carry[i];
        fResult1[i] -= carry[i] * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);
    }
    
    carry[9] = (fResult1[9] + (int64_t)(1L << 24)) >> 25;
    fResult1[0] += carry[9] * 19;
    fResult1[9]-= carry[9] * ((uint64_t) 1L << 25);
    
    fResult1[0] = fResult1[0]+ ((int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
    
    h = f[0]/fResult1;
    return h;


}

int64_t generalEquation(int32_t* f0, int64_t* fPrev_, int64_t* fNew_){
    int64_t fResult[10], result;

    for (int i = 0; i<10; i++){
        fResult[i] = f0[i] + fNew_[i] + fPrev_[i];
    }

    for(int i = 0; i<10; i++){
        result *= fResult[i];
    }

    return result;
}


This above program simplifies the initial function changing a lot of routine code automating with few loops and simplifying the complex equations that are being used repetitively. Differences in variability between compilers, optimization qualities as well as other system features may result in performance differences.
