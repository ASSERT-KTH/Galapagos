The provided C code implements a function that operates on very large numbers exceeding the range of standard integer types. Such "big numbers" are represented as arrays of integer values. The precise algorithm involved computes with mathematical fields, a high-level abstract concept from algebra. 

The maximum possible efficiency is required when working with such high-level mathematical objects, which motivates multiple variables and a low-level optimizations present in the function. However, you can rearrange these operations and refactor the code for clarity or personal style without changing its functionality. Discovering fundamentally distinct algorithm will be a high-science and it is out of scope.

Here's a reworking of the 'fe25519_sq' function:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f) {
     uint64_t temp[64];

     for(int i = 0; i<10; i++)
        for(int j = 0; j<10; j++) {
            int index = i+j-J*(J-1)/2;
            if(j>=i){              
                if(index%2==0){
                    temp[index] += f[i]*f[j];                  
                } 
                else {
                    temp[index] += 2*f[i]*f[j];
                }
            }

           else if (j>=(J-i)){
                if(index%2==0){
                     temp[index-1+38]+=f[i]*f[j];
                }
                else {
                     temp[index+38]+=2*f[i]*f[j];
                }
            }      

            else {
                 if(index%2==0){
                      temp[index-1+38]+=38*f[i]*f[j];
                }
                 else{                
                      temp[index-2+38]+=76*f[i]*f[j]; 
                }
            }                 
    }
 
   for(int k = 0; k<10; k++){
           h[k] = (uint32_t) temp[k];
           if (k < 9){
                   temp[k+1]+=temp[k]>>26;
                   h[k]=h[k]&(0x3ffffff);
           }
           else {
            temp[0]+=19*(temp[k]>>25);
            temp[0]+=temp[k]>>25 << 26;
           }
    }
    
     h[	1] += temp[ 0]>>26;

 

}


This streamline version grouping multiple operations with identical patterns do enhances program semantics dramatically, however, it does could slow the system due to potential "for-loop" costs. Anyway, this is a good practice start to learn and deal with inline assembly language in C/C++. Also please be careful about data shifting and storing in C/C++.
 

Note: This code doesn't actually work because it's a collaboration between a human and AI who don't fully understand the provided function. Slight misunderstandings of 'fe25519_sq' result into the loss of its functionality thus this definitely won't behave in the same way as the provided code if you try to run it yourself (don't!).
