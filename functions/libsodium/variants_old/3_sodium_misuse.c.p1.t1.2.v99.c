Here is a variant of the function which functionality remains the same, but behavior could be a bit different in error cases if the "_misuse_handler" handler has some additional conditions of whether to abort the program or not and because an additional validation check has been added:


void sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    if (sodium_crit_enter() != 0) {
        (void) sodium_crit_leave();
        abort();
    }
    
    if ((handler = _misuse_handler) != NULL) {
        handler();
    }

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
}  


In this variant, we altered the structure of conditions lightly:
1) After entering the critical section, if sodium_crit_enter() returns anything but 0 (assumed as an error), the function aborts.
2) If the handler != NULL, then the handler would be called.
3) Lastly, it leaves the "critical section" (defined by the "sodium_crit_leave" function), which wasn't guaranteed in the original implementation. Whether this difference is beneficial or unfriendly depends on the specifics of the functions "sodium_crit_leave", "sodium_crit_enter" and the general program flow.

Remember this variant acts a bit different but functionality is mainly the preserved, depending on the rest of the system, this could have different minor impacts.
