Sure, in the given code variants using different techniques for zeroing memory exist, and correct technique is chosen based on what specific support is available in a particulart build environment. Here, we'll implement the underlying logic using `memset()` directly.


#include <string.h>

void sodium_memzero(void * const pnt, const size_t len)
{
    if (pnt == NULL) {
        return;
    }

    memset(pnt, 0, len);
}


This program variant has the exactly same effect as the original function, which is, it sets the memory area pointed by pnt of length len bytes with zero. It uses the standard library function `memset()` directly which is available in standard C and it is portable. Rectification of null pointer added for safety. Also, irrespective of the scenario, `memset()` works as it guarantees to set all bytes in the required memory area, including padding bytes, if any, making this a foolproof alternative.

This variant does not assume features provided by some compilers (like `_WIN32`, `HAVE_MEMSET_S`, `HAVE_EXPLICIT_BZERO`, `HAVE_MEMSET_EXPLICIT`, `HAVE_EXPLICIT_MEMSET`, `HAVE_WEAK_SYMBOLS`, `HAVE_INLINE_ASM`), rather it directly relies on a standard C function `memset()`. This variant will work across all compilers and platforms that support standard C. However, it may not fulfill some extra wishes like resistance against compiler's optimization techniques which might skip zeroing vacant memory chunks.
