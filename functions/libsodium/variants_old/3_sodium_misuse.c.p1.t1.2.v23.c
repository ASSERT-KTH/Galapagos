The function variant provided involves using `else` alongside `if` statement causing the handler function to execute only if `sodium_crit_enter()` returns 0. It also aborts the application (using `abort()`) if it doesn't enter the `if` block but this would be optional depending on how we want to recover from the misuse case. 


void sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
        }
    } else {
        /* MISUSE CASE STUFF TO HANDLE IA STARTS HERE */

        /* For safety, we may make a call to system function to abort the mission */
        /* Code to abort subsequently... */
        abort();

        /* MISUSE CASE STUFF TO HANDLE ENDS HERE */
    }
}

This variant of the sodium_misuse() function maintains its original functionality, However, I also included an `else` clause delivering alternate code execution if `sodium_crit_enter()` does not return 0. 

This else section can contain required Misuse Case Handler or extra code to handle diverse behavior. Our replacement could opt for an abort function invocation as a trivial example.
