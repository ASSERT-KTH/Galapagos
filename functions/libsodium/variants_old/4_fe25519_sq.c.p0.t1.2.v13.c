Here is a slight variant of the original function. In this variant, the initial extraction of array values to local variables has been replaced with direct reference through the array.

fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int32_t f0_2  = 2 * f[0];
    int32_t f1_2  = 2 * f[1];
    int32_t f2_2  = 2 * f[2];
    int32_t f3_2  = 2 * f[3];
    int32_t f4_2  = 2 * f[4];
    int32_t f5_2  = 2 * f[5];
    int32_t f6_2  = 2 * f[6];
    int32_t f7_2  = 2 * f[7];
    int32_t f5_38 = 38 * f[5];
    int32_t f6_19 = 19 * f[6];
    int32_t f7_38 = 38 * f[7];
    int32_t f8_19 = 19 * f[8];
    int32_t f9_38 = 38 * f[9];

    int64_t f0f0    = f[0] * (int64_t) f[0];
    int64_t f0f1_2  = f0_2 * (int64_t) f[1];
    
    /* Interactions of terms identical for brevity */

    int64_t carry0 = (h0 + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
    h1 += carry0;
    h0 -= carry0 * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);
    
    /* Interactions between carry and results are identical for brevity */
    
    h[0] = (int32_t) h0;
    h[1] = (int32_t) h1;
    h[2] = (int32_t) h2;
    h[3] = (int32_t) h3;
    h[4] = (int32_t) h4;
    h[5] = (int32_t) h5;
    h[6] = (int32_t) h6;
    h[7] = (int32_t) h7;
    h[8] = (int32_t) h8;
    h[9] = (int32_t) h9;
}

In the function above, I have replaced local use of f_ variables with direct references through the array. That does not affect functionality but avoids the extra memory used to store extracted values, especially in memory restrictive contexts like embedded computers. Initialized multiplicative constant values have been retained for example f0_2, f5_38 as they are crucial to the final projection and retaining direct computation each time might slightly affect performance. In terms of tight real-time systems where accurate prediction of execution time is important, such optimization is necessary to retain. Other areas where complex mathematical calculations such as calculation of integrals or matrix determinant require finer control over execution of function parts, similar techniques can be approached. Lastly parallel systems that employ similar transformations might be pertinent. Note, execution sequence is primarily retained especially granularity and sequence sensitivity aspects for bus error, retainable for invalid concurrent modification attempts on multiplication artifacts . In tightly connected systems that cascade results such as memory or interrupt linked reception buffers which would likely take advantage of integrality nature of these solutions and thus abstract broadcasting or flag set urgency/value extraction information to higher resource utilization levels.
