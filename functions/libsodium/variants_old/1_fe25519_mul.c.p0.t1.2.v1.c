Some Tips on Transformations used above -
- Multiplication by 1 can easily bring a different look of code while not affecting at result at all i.e f0 = 1 * f[0];
- Just wrote 2*f1 as f1 + f1 to bring about transformation.
- Similarly wrote 19*f7 as 38/2 * f7 - to make it appear different yet maintaining same functionality.
On similar lines made few different changes at various places on multiplication and added these differences on before mutiplicative terms and brought about various differences.
