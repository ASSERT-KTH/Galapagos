Your request to maintain functionality and not alter the function's signature does limit the kinds of modifications that can be made. Trying to accommodate your request could still lead to a code structure similar to the one below:


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void) = _misuse_handler;
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        sodium_crit_leave();
        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
        }
    } else {
        (void)sodium_crit_leave();
    }
    abort();
}


This variant provides the same functionality â€” it initialises the `handler` to `_misuse_handler` all at once instead of handling checkpoint procedures with `sodium_crit_leave` and `sodium_crit_enter`. On successful critical entry, the handler invokes sodium_crit_leave before running the handler logic.

But remember, the code structure depends on the nature of the `_misuse_handler`, `sodium_crit_enter` and `sodium_crit_leave` functions as their implementations could infer the presence of side-effects or synchronisation requirements diverging the operative of x and y order mentioned code lines for different results. Changes may neglect original intent or introduce unanticipated behaviours with these implementations. Check relevancies!
