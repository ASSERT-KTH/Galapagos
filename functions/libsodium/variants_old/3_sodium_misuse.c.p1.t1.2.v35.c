Here is an improvised variant of the reference code. It preserves the original functioning but with slightly different behavior where I've included a return statement right after the function is being called and also assigned NULL to the handler after used.
  
  
sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void) = NULL;

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    if(sodium_crit_enter()== 0)
    {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if(handler) 
        {
            handler();
            handler = NULL;
            return;  // Exits once done calling the handler and no fallback to abort
        }  
    }
    /* LCOV_EXCL_START */
    abort();
}

In the given program variant changes:
a) The handler pointer is now FIRST initialized to NULL.
b) Upon entering the critical section and if a misuse_handler (_misuse_handler) exists, it will be executed.
c) This handler is, IMMEDIATELY post the execution, set to NULL, 'freeing' it rather unused orders thereby avoiding possible memory issues in prospective runs.
d) Also, avoids invoking abort after running the _misuse_handler, thereby soft-relaxing the error part.
  
This variant ensures that the function follows a definitive flow than ambiguous one (about what happens if _misuse_handler is invoked) in the original. The current code provides a nominal understanding to a viewer and adheres the standard practice of setting the handler to NULL once used.
