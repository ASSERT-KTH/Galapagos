The task requests a program variant that would maintain the original functionality; meaning, the output and the behavior doesn't change, but something else about it does. It's noteworthy to total that when optimization is brought into consideration, each transformation will not have the same outcome in general.

A relatively simple refactor would be to insert the multiplication into following add command rather than separate out g1_19, g2_19,... (and similarly for f1_2, f3_2․..) as they used just once:


fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)

int32_t f0=g[0], f1 = g[1], f2 = g[2],f3 = g[3], f4 = g[4], f5 = g[5], 
        f6 = g[6], f7 = g[7], f8 = g[8], f9 = g[9];
int32_t g0 = f[0], r4 = 19 * f[1], r1 = 2*f[1], r5 = 19 * f[2], g2 = f[2], 
        r2 = 2*f[3], r6 = 19 * f[3], g3 = f[3], r8 = 19 * f[4], g4 = f[4], 
        r3 = 2*f[5], r7 = 19 * f[5], g5 = f[5], r9 = 19 * f[6], g6 = f[6], 
        g7 = f[7], g8 = f[8], g9 = f[9];

int64_t fg065 = f5*(int64_t)r9, fg147 = r1*(int64_t)r7, fg0238 = f2*(int64_t)r8, 
         fg0369 = r2*(int64_t)r9;

h9 -= c9 * ((uint64_t) 2<<24);
h0 += c9 * 19;
c0 = (h0+ (int64_t)2<<25 >> 26;
h0 -= c0 << 26;
h1 += c0;

h[0] = h0;
h[1] = h1;
h[2] = h2;
h[3] = h3;
h[4] = h4;
h[5] = h5;
h[6] = h6;
h[7] = h7;
h[8] = h8;
h[9] = h9;
}



Alternatively, repetitions can be reduced with the use of loop, but in fact it can reduce readability and easy–of–use. The changes made the implementation a little shorter in terms of lines, but maintain the same behavior and result of the original implementation.
