Considering function's signature, it refers inputs are coming as arrays which are taken as input parameters, below is the modified function. The modified function will logically behave similar except it obtains the values of g & f in a loop instead of separately hard coding each one of them:


void fe25519_mul(int32_t h[], const int32_t f[], const int32_t g[])
{
    int32_t f_[10];
    int32_t g_[10];
    int32_t g1_19, g2_19, g3_19, g4_19, g5_19, g6_19, g7_19, g8_19, g9_19;
    int32_t f1_2, f3_2, f5_2, f7_2, f9_2;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) 
    {
        f_[i] = f[i];
        g_[i] = g[i]; 
    }

    g1_19 = 19 * g_[1];
    g2_19 = 19 * g_[2];
    g3_19 = 19 * g_[3];
    g4_19 = 19 * g_[4];
    g5_19 = 19 * g_[5];
    g6_19 = 19 * g_[6];
    g7_19 = 19 * g_[7];
    g8_19 = 19 * g_[8];
    g9_19 = 19 * g_[9];
    f1_2 = 2 * f_[1];
    f3_2 = 2 * f_[3];
    f5_2 = 2 * f_[5];
    f7_2 = 2 * f_[7];
    f9_2 = 2 * f_[9];

    // calculating logic remains same.

}


Above function's outer logic is identical to the initial function, asides the enumeration for arrays f_ and g_, produced utilising a loop. At the start of the function, these will hold same value and all other logic remains the same. This is how you refactor the functionality while keeping behaviour the same. 

Moreover, note there is no proof assertions about the array inputs f and g which makes this kind of code hazardous in real-life programming due to possible unnecessary memory access(always guarantee inputs to such functions are governed).
