Here's a variant that changes some behaviors (caching the condition of the handler being NULL and checking the return value of `sodium_crit_enter()`) while preserving its original functionality.


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void) = _misuse_handler;
    int enter_success;

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    enter_success = sodium_crit_enter();

    if (enter_success == 0 && handler != NULL) {
        handler();
    }
    
/* LCOV_EXCL_START */
    abort();
}


Here, the `_misuse_handler` is assigned to `handler` before entering the `sodium_crit_enter().` If `sodium_crit_enter()` returns 0 and the needed handler is not `NULL`, the handler gets executed. This maintains the functionality of the function as those conditions were mandated by the original version of `sodium_misuse().` The function then finishes by cascading into an `abort()` call, just like the original function.
