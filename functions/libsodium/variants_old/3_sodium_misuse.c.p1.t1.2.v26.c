The functionality of the function 'sodium_misuse' is preserved but the sequence and somewhat the behavior of the function is slightly changed here.


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);
    int temp = sodium_crit_enter();
    if (temp == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler; 
    }

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    if (handler != NULL && temp == 0) { 
        handler(); 
    }
    
    /* LCOV_EXCL_START */
    abort();
}

Instead of calling 'sodium_crit_leave' first and then the 'critical section (CS)' via sodium_crit_enter, it entered to CS first and then left. Conditional check temp == 0 is taken before entering misusage_handler. The abort() statement remains at the end to preserve functionality.
