Here is a function variant that maintains the original functionality but changes the behavior of the original function. This variant achieves everything in a single loop than individually assigning and computing values.


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int64_t temp[19] = {0};
    int64_t carry;

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) 
    {
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; ++j)
        {
            temp[i+j] += (i == j) ? f[i] * (int64_t) f[j] : 2*f[i] * (int64_t) f[j];

            if (i+j >= 9 && (i+j)%2 == 0) 
            {
                temp[i+j-9] += ((i+j == 10) ? 38 : 19) * temp[i+j];
                temp[i+j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
  
    carry = (temp[0] + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
    temp[1] += carry; temp[0] -= carry * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);
    carry = (temp[4] + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
    temp[5] += carry; temp[4] -= carry * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);
    
    for(int i=1; i<10; i+=2)
    {
        carry = (temp[i]+(int64_t)(1L<<24)) >> 25; 
        temp[i+1] += carry; temp[i] -= carry * ((uint64_t) 1L << 25);

        int j = (i+1)%10;  // get the next even value in temp, circled back to the start for j=5/7/9
        carry = (temp[j]+(int64_t)(1L<<25)) >> 26; 
        temp[(j+1)%10] += carry; temp[j] -= carry * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);
    }
    
    carry = (temp[9]+(int64_t)(1L<<24)) >> 25; 
    temp[0] += 19*carry; temp[9] -= carry*((uint64_t) 1L << 25);
    carry = (temp[0]+(int64_t)(1L<<25)) >> 26; 
    temp[1] += carry; temp[0] -= carry*((uint64_t) 1L << 26);

    for(int i=0; i<10; i++) h[i] = (int32_t) temp[i];
}


Note: Supposing that the provided term `fe25519` has been defined somewhere else in your program to be an array of 10, 32-bit signed integers, just like `f` and `h` are being treated in the refactor. If it's some other type, adjust accordingly. Also consider how much we trust input `f` won't have signed result of any of the calculations.
