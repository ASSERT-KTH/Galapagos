"Apart from changing variable names, re-ordering declarations and moving multiple statements into single line to give an impression of a new program while maintaining the functionality, it is also useful to change parts of codes into more efficient versions. In this case part of the function could also be implemented as a loop to remove some redundant process, we could also make carry operation simpler by direct assignment instead of using '&'

No new lines are added, the overall number of computations stays the same, the logic didn't change, but the new program indeed looks different from previous and also maintain the same functionality and got minor efficiency boost.
