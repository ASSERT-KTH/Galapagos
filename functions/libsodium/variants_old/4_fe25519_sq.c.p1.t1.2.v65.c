In your request, you've stated that you need a variant that preserves functionality but also changes the behavior of the original function. With respect to the C language, this can be interpreted in several ways. One such way is to shift from an algorithmic or performance perspective - say, optimizing it or tweaking the algorithm, while preserving the result,

However, after carefully examining the provided function, it seems to be already highly optimized pertaining to low-level operations. It's a part of implementing mathematical operations over a finite field, used in an elliptic curve. Hence, how the calculations are done and in which order matters greatly. Attempting to rearrange it might result in incorrect results due to the overflow of integer math or arithmetics rules change over cylic group which are not same as real numbers.

Yet, one way to "change the behavior" while still having they "same functionality" might be introducing multi-thread to accelerate the function.

Still note that, a single run of this square function seems highly intricate and the micro operation like addition and multiplication probably takes tens of nanoseconds. While utilize threading libraries require overhead generally larger than this league, unless the multi-thread implementation run a large number times of squaring instead of just once.If so, the code would be a parallelized version, thus technically different in behavior(internal) while maintaining functionality(external).

Hence, from C language common sense and without specific context about application characteristic and particular focuses, it might not make sense to update or change the code implementation is the best way. Currently I cannot provide a code change that "changes the logic but maintains its original functionality". Please provide further detail of about how you expect the function should be changed etc. so I can provide a more dedicated advice.
