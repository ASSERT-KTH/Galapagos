The C code for the program variant might look something like this:


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void) = _misuse_handler;

    (void)sodium_crit_leave();

    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0 && handler) {
        handler();
    } else {
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    /* LCOV_EXCL_START */
    assert(false);
    abort();
}

In this variant, it takes `_misuse_handler` directly as a handler, and prepares a backup call for `exit()` in addition to the call to `abort()`, which might be unnecessary but offers an alternative misbehavior handling method. It uses `assert(false)` as a method of misbehavior against from deviating the normal code execution path. While it deviates from a conventional usage scenario, it still makes use of built-in function and may serve same functionality. Please be advise that the particular behaviour might depend on difference system.
