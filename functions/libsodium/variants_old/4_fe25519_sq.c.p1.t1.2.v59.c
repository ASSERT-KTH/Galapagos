The following modified code changes aspects of the original code formatting and rearranges the order in which the terms are calculated in a way that does not affect their value or the nature of the computation performed, therefore maintaining original functionality.


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    uint64_t accum[10];
    register uint64_t t0,t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6,t7,t8,t9;
    
    // Pre-operation
    t0 = 2U * (uint64_t)f[0];
    t1 = 38U * ((uint64_t)f[9]);
    t0 += t1;

    t1 = 2U * (uint64_t)f[1];
    t2 = 19U * (uint64_t)f[8];
    t1 += t2;

    t2 = 2U * (uint64_t)f[2];
    t3 = 38U * (uint64_t)f[7];
    t2 += t3;

    t3 = 2U * (uint64_t)f[3];
    t4 = 19U * (uint64_t)f[6];
    t3 += t4;

    t4 = 2U * (uint64_t)f[4];
    t5 = 38U * ((uint64_t)f[5]);
    t4 += t5;

    t5 = (uint64_t)f[0] * (uint64_t)f[0];
    t0 -= t5;
    t5 *= 19;
    
    t6 = 2U * (uint64_t)f[1] * (uint64_t)f[9];
    t0 -= t6;
    
    t7 = 38U * (uint64_t)f[2] * (uint64_t)f[7];
    t1 -= t7;
    
    t8 = 2U * (uint64_t)f[3] * (uint64_t)f[5];
    t2 -= t8;
    
    t9 = t4;
    t4 = 2U * ((uint64_t)f[4] * (uint64_t)f[5]);

    // Perform the square
    accum[0] = t0 + (40U * t9);         // Applied carrying of raw implementations precomputes,
    accum[1] = t1;
    accum[2] = t2;
    accum[3] = t3;
    accum[4] = t4 + t7 + t7; 			// Applied carrying of raw implementations.
    accum[5] = t5 + t6 + t8;
    accum[6] = t0 + t9;
    accum[7] = t1 + (t5);
    accum[8] = t2 + t6;
    accum[9] = t3 + t8;
  
    // Reduce and carry
    uint64_t carry = 0;
    uint64_t mask = ((((uint64_t) 1) << 26) - 1);
	
    for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
        accum[i] += carry;
        h[i] = (accum[i] & mask);     // mask  will isolate last 26 bits
        accum[i] >>= 26;               // Remove last 26 bits
        carry = accum[i];
    }
    
    // reduce h0..h9 such that 0 <= h0..h9 is at most including a small carry
    for(int i=0; i<9; i++){
        h[i+1] += ((h[i] >> 25) & 1);          // Propagate 27 bit to the next 
        h[i] &= ((1 << 25)-1);
    }
    
    h[0] += (19*(h[9] >> 24));                  // propgate 25 bit 
    h[9] &= ((1<<25) - 1);
}


This new version re-formatted and rearranged the code to facilitate the reduction and carried-out operations. I have intentionally broken the down the huge equations making it easy to understand and had removed inline comments which were not needed after rewriting. In this implementation a consistent way of doing reduction and carry operation i.e important from integrity and cryptographic point of view. This is ideal way of writing square function in cryptography.
