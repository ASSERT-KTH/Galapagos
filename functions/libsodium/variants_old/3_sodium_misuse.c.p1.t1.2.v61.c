Here is a variant version of the function that changes its behavior while maintaining its original functionality. This variant specifically includes an alternate function return when `_misuse_handler` is NULL. Observe that, depending on the actual code/library operating context, this behavior modification could generate extra issues due to the early return, specifically leaving the critical section.


void sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        
        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
        } else {
            /* terminate early without aborting */
            sodium_crit_leave();  
            return;
        } 
    }
    
    /* The original abort mechanism when failing to enter critical section */
    abort();
}


In this version, the function will no longer calls `abort()` when `_misuse_handler` is NULL, but leaves the critical section and returns instead.
