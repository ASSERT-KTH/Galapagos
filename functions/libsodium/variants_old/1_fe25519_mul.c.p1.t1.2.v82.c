One trivial activity to preserve the original functionality but change the underlying behavior could be to rearrange the initializations of the constants and to jumble the copy of an array's individuals.


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
  int32_t f0 = f[0], f1 = f[5], f2 = f[4], f3 = f[2], f4 = f[9];
  int32_t f5 = f[6], f6 = f[8], f7 = f[1], f8 = f[3], f9 = f[7];
  
  int32_t g0 = g[4], g1 = g[5], g2 = g[9], g3 = g[0], g4 = g[7];
  int32_t g5 = g[1], g6 = g[8], g7 = g[3], g8 = g[6], g9 = g[2];

  int32_t g1_19 = 19 * g5;
  int32_t g2_19 = 19 * g9;
  
  // and so on...

  int64_t h0 = f4g6_19 + f6g8_19 + f9g1_38 + f0g0 + f1g9_38
                      + f2g8_19 + f3g7_38 + f5g5_38 +
                      f7g3_38 + f8g2_19;
                      
  int64_t f1g0    = f6 * (int64_t) g8;
  int64_t f1g9_38 = f9_2 * (int64_t) g1_19;

  // maintain the order of operations as earlier
}

The functionality remains the same because the operations inside the function are associative and commutative, but the order in which these constants and computations are executed is pseudorandom and unordered. This method preserves the functional integrity of the function since it uses the same set of operations, resulting in the same outcomes and identical inputs, but modifies how these operations function.
