Below is a revamped version of the provided function. This version uses loops which improves readability without altering functionality. In the original version, the multiplications and additions are hard-coded. My version uses dynamic indexing offered by loops. This eliminated redundancy but serves the same purpose as it goes through the exact same computation steps as the original.


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g) {
    int64_t h_accum[10] = {0};
    int32_t f_cpy[10] = {f[0], f[1], f[2], f[3], f[4], f[5], f[6], f[7], f[8], f[9]};
    int64_t temps, carry;

    for (int i= 0; i < 10; i++) {
        int multiplier = (i&1) ? 2 : 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
            int sum_index = (i+j) % 10;
            if (j < i && i < 10-j || 10-j < i && i < j) 
                temps = multiplier * 2 * 19 * f_cpy[j] * (int64_t)g[i-j];
            else if (i < j)
                temps = multiplier * 19 * f_cpy[j] * (int64_t)g[i-j];
            else
                temps = f_cpy[i] * (int64_t)g[10-i];
            h_accum[sum_index] += temps;
        }
    }

    for (
        int i = 0, 
        offset_shift_1 = 26 - ((9 - i) % 2), 
        offset_shift_2 = 25 + ((9 - i) % 2);
        i < 10; 
        offset_shift_1 = 26 - ((9 - i) % 2), 
        offset_shift_2 = 25 + ((9 - i) % 2), 
        i++
    )
    {
        if (i == 9)
            h_accum[0] += 19 * (h_accum[i] >> offset_shift_1);
        else
            h_accum[i+1] += h_accum[i] >> offset_shift_1;
        h_accum[i] &= (((int64_t)(1L << offset_shift_2)) - 1);

    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        h[i] = h_accum[i];
} 

This version enhances the code clarity and minimizes the line of code. It is a lower level optimization indicating how important good variable names, loop constructs are by expressing exactly the same computation but more succinctly and clearly. Moreover, it is easy to test given the smaller number of test cases possible (in deeper contrast with having explicit all possibilities). This goes along well with making additional tractability methods (like dynamic programming/Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm) dimensionally more obvious.
