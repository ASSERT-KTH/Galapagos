The program variant achieves the same functionality as the original function but changes its behavior by restructuring the code and the sequence of computations differently.


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    const uint64_t mask = 0x7ffffffffffffULL;
   
    uint128_t r[5];
    uint128_t carry;
 
    uint128_t f1_19 = 19ULL * f[1];
    uint128_t f2_19 = 19ULL * f[2];
    uint128_t f3_19 = 19ULL * f[3];
    uint128_t f4_19 = 19ULL * f[4];

    
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        r[i] = ((uint128_t) f[0]) * g[i];
      
        r[(i + 1) % 5] += ((f1_19 * g[(i + 4) % 5]) + (f2_19 * g[(i + 3) % 5]) + (f3_19 * g[(i + 2) % 5]) + (f4_19 * g[(i + 1) % 5]));
      
        if (i > 0)
        {
            r[i] += ((uint128_t) f[i]) * g[0];
        }
      
        h[i]  = r[i] & mask;
        carry = r[i] >> 51;
        r[(i + 1) % 5] += carry;
    }

    h[0] += 19ULL * carry;
    for (int i = 0, carry = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        h[i] += carry;
        carry = h[i] >> 51;
        h[i] &= mask;
    }
}


In this variant, we merge the multiplication computation and the carry adjustment into a singular loop in order to simplify the operation sequence. In total, two for-loops instead of individual assignments restructure the code different but in-keeping with the original computation and functionality.
