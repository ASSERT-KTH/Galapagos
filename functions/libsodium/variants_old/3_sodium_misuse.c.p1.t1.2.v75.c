Here is a possible variant of the function. This variant maintains the original functionality but adds some potential error handling for the `abort()` call by checking if `handler` was indeed called and by considering `sodium_crit_enter()` might fail.


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    int crit_leave_status = sodium_crit_leave();

    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;

        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
            return; //exit the function if handler is called successfully
        }
    }

    if (crit_leave_status != 0 || handler == NULL) {
        abort(); //only abort if sodium_crit_leave failed or handler was never assigned
    }
}
 

It changes behavior because the `abort()` is not always called, only under certain conditions now.

Note: This depends on the semantics and constraints around `sodium_crit_enter` or `sodium_crit_leave()` and whether `_misuse_handler` is set globally within the scope of the function.
