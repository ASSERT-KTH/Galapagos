Here's a variant of the original function which maintains the original functionality:

Instead of previous values of array 'f' multiple times by different elements, here caching those permanently modified values by declaring and computing new variables for them, then use these computed values later in place of recomputing them again internally as in the reference code! This version is reorganized, uses these computed variables, yet functionally equivalent.

Modifying a code while maintaining all functionality is also known as 'Refactor Code'. Here you cannot do so much, its perfect in terms of 'uses arrays and structure' or 'the algorithms itself can not be improved'. But this presented way describes beneficial habit to follow for improving code base, with meaningful variables along with less computation which may hinder performance relative within and over large code bases.

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
