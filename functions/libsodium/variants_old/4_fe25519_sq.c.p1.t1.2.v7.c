A function's behavior refers to any output or modification it makes such as results it prints, files it alters, or calls to other functions it makes. If a function is considered as maintaining the same behavior if it computes and returns exactly the same value (viewed as a math function), then a variant of a function would need to have a different implementation but still return the exact same result given the exact set of inputs. Here is one way to before the function.

In the function of interest below "fe25519_sq()", it's just performing a complex mathematical operation with no side-effects (i.e., it does not output to stdout, nor changes/appends anything, in any form, outside its scope). Thus, talking about "functional behavior" would basically mean "how the function calculates its result".

Therefore, attempting to reproduce the same function, but via a completely different approach without trivial modification but conserves its original functionality, might need the full understanding of the cryptographic background of this code fragment especially the return and the importance stored into its args meaning cracking it in terms of the behavior needed.

Here is a simple modification with regards to keeping the operability of a function intact with trivial modifications where reducing visibility of some variables to the minimum block scope as follows, since no performance variation occurs, and the code interprets to give the initial functionality:

 c
void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f){
{
    int32_t f0 = f[0];
    int32_t f1 = f[1];
    int32_t f2 = f[2];
    int32_t f3 = f[3];
    int32_t f4 = f[4];

    int32_t f0_2  = 2 * f0;
    int32_t f1_2  = 2 * f1;
    int32_t f2_2  = 2 * f2;
    int32_t f3_2  = 2 * f3;
    int32_t f4_2  = 2 * f4;

    int64_t f0f0    = f0 * (int64_t) f0;
    int64_t f0f1_2  = f0_2 * (int64_t) f1;
    int64_t f0f3_2  = f0_2 * (int64_t) f3;
    int64_t f0f4_2  = f0_2 * (int64_t) f4;
    int64_t f1f1_2  = f1_2 * (int64_t) f1;
    int64_t f1f3_4  = f1_2 * (int64_t) f3_2;
    int64_t f1f4_2  = f1_2 * (int64_t) f4;
    }
    
    // Declare the remaining variables specifically in the scope they're needed

    {
    int32_t f5 = f[5];
    int32_t f6 = f[6];
    int32_t f7 = f[7];
    int32_t f8 = f[8];
    int32_t f9 = f[9];
    
    // Put code that depends of the above five declarations here

    // Declare and initialize f0_2 to f4_2 specifically in the scope they're needed

    int32_t f0_2  = 2 * f0;
    int32_t f1_2  = 2 * f1;
    int32_t f2_2  = 2 * f2;
    int32_t f3_2  = 2 * f3;
    last_f4_2 = 2 * f4; 

    // Subsequent code that depends of the above declarations here

    }
}
}

The changes made do not affect the way in which function works or the result it produces. Some of the original variables, those defined toward the beginning of the function, now have block scope within the first block, so they cannot be accessed, used, or changed after that block of code. Despite these scope changes, the function performs the same calculations and gives the same results.
