Here is a variant of the sodium_misuse() function which changes its behavior while maintaining its original functionality. This variant wraps the original function code in a try-catch statement void: 


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    try {
        (void) sodium_crit_leave();
        if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
            handler = _misuse_handler;
            if (handler != NULL) {
                handler();
            }
        }
    } catch (exception& e) {
        // Handle the error appropriately
    }

/* LCOV_EXCL_START */
    abort();
}


Please note that some semantics like try and catch statements are not inherently available in C language, unlike C++. However, there are ways to implement error handling in C, using setjmp and longjmp functions from the setjmp library, these are closer at emulating try and catch semantics. 

This function keeps all the original behavior of the first version. The most significant change the function's flavor is error handling. With the try-catch wrapper, potential exceptions generated by sodium_crit_enter() or handler() calls are now being explicitly caught and can be handled. This can obviate the program getting closed with sudden crashes whenever those functions fails, which may have existed in the original function.
