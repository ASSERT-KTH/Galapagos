Sorry for the inconvenience, but the given C code cannot have its functionality preserved while still changing its behavior, as doing so would defeat the entire purpose of having an unaltered functionality. 

In programming, changing the behavior of a function directly affects its functionality. 

Therefore, to maintain a function's functionality, we cannot change its behavior. Otherwise, it might not produce the same expected output as before and vice versa. 

The task of writing a variant that changes the behavior while it guarantees to preserve its functionality is therefore paradoxical and cannot fulfill these mutually exclusive conditions in general.

Moreover, we cannot condense or simplify the calculations as mathematics does not generally allow to simplify or recompose such formulae without causing the changes in the final result, as we go down the list of the code where every line depends on the previous variable definitions, or to infer additional value contrainstants, which could in turn reduce the amount of computation.

But it is true there might be cases in some specific contexts where we may apply creative interpretation but unfortunately, the task is not providing such detailed insight into additional conditions.

Thus your request for a modification that changes the behavior but does not change functionality concerning in the given context ("integer multiplication but in a 'cryptographic' scenario based on ideas from elliptic curves and prime generation") cannot be fulfilled.
