The question asks for program variant which will not make change in the original functionality of the operations that exist in the original program.This implcits that, a change which doesn't alter the code in the process of mathematical calculations. For instance, in general, a*b+x*y, in terms of giving same results doesn't differ from the use x*y+a*b. Using the associations and decompositions, the procedures would be altered).  Consequently we can change the Program's Variant as follows:


fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int64_t h0,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,h7,h8,h9;
    int64_t carry0,carry1,carry2,carry3,carry4,carry5,carry6,carry7,carry8,carry9;

    int32_t f0 = f[0];
    int32_t f1 = f[1];
    int32_t f2 = f[2];
    int32_t f3 = f[3];
    int64_t f0_2  = 2 * f0;
    int64_t f1_2  = 2 * f1;
    int64_t f0f1_2  = f0_2 * f1;
    int64_t f1f2_2 = f1_2 * f2;

    /*the rest of the code that involve on multiplication and addition */

    carry9 = (h9 + (int64_t)(1L << 24)) >> 25; 
    carry0 = (h0 + carry9 * 19 + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
    h1 += carry0; h0 -= carry0 * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);
    h9 -= carry9 * ((uint64_t) 1L << 25);
    
    h[0] = (int32_t) h0;
    h[1] = (int32_t) h1;
    h[2] = (int32_t) h2;
    h[3] = (int32_t) h3;
    h[4] = (int32_t) h4;
    h[5] = (int32_t) h5;
    h[6] = (int32_t) h6;
    h[7] = (int32_t) h7;
    h[8] = (int32_t) h8;
    h[9] = (int32_t) h9;
}

In the above snippet code, operation arry0 = (h0 + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26 is decomposed into operation arry0 = (h0 + carry9 * 19 + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26 . If we see representatively,  previous was y = a   , now after decomposed transform it became z = a +(c -c) , so z=y.
