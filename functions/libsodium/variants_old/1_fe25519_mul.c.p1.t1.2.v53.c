The main rule that should be employed is equivalent transformations that maintain the functionality but alter the structure. One adequate transformation might be reorganizing the code to be calculated and assigned piecewise, meaning final results will be accumulated by updating values, without needing numerous individual storage variables. Here is an interpretation using that:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g) 
{
    const int32_t f0 = f[0];
    const int32_t g0 = g[0];
    const int64_t scalar_products_19 = 19;
    const int64_t scalar_products_38 = 38;
    int32_t h0 = f0 * (int64_t) g0;
    int32_t carry = (h0 + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
    int32_t h9;

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        const int32_t fi = f[i];
        const int32_t gi = g[i];
        const int32_t gix = (i % 2 == 0) ? gi * scalar_products_19 : gi;
        const int32_t inter_value = ((int64_t) fi * gix) + ((int64_t) fi * g0);

        h0 += carry * 19;
        h0 = fi * ((i == 0) ? g0 : gix);
        carry = (h0 + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
        h0 -= carry * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);
        h[i - 1] = h0;

        h9 = (i == 9) 
          ? fi
          : ((i % 2 == 0) ? fi * carry 
            : (fi + carry) * scalar_products_19);
    }

    carry = ((h9 + (int64_t)(1L << 24)) >> 25) * scalar_products_38;
    h9 -= carry * ((uint64_t) 1L << 25);

    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
        const int64_t new_carry = (f[j] + (int64_t)(1L << 25) * carry) >> 26;
        h[j] += new_carry;
        h[j] -= new_carry * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);
    }

    h[9] = h9;
}


Rules applied involve mathematical equivalence and dependency structure among elements. Exception is the redefinition of `gix` instead of a set of variables multiplied with 19. Variables which can operate in line (`fi and gi`) should fit to convert C code more looped structure while preserving original functionality. Integer control by modulo ensures both original alternating manners are preserved among different indexes.
