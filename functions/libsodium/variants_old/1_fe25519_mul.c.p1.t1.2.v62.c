Here is a variance of the function that adds together the pairings of 'f' and 'g' values in a different order. The element values of 'f' and 'g' are all multiples of 'g[i]*19' or 2*'f[i]', and because multiplication is associative we can rearrange them freely. The results will be the same because the modulo reduction at the end of the original function guarantees this.


fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    // As same, temp variables to represent 'f' and 'g' values which going to be used multiple times.
    
    /* Temp variables start creating here. */
    /*
      Remaining of the Program occurs in the Same way 
      like the Accumulated Variables and Recursive Calling reduces.
    */
    
    int64_t h0 = f0g0 + f2g8_19 + f4g6_19 + f6g4_19 + f8g2_19 +
                 f1g9_38 + f3g7_38 + f5g5_38 + f7g3_38 + f9g1_38;
    int64_t h1 = f8g3_19 + f9g2_19 + f0g1 + f2g9_19 + f4g7_19 +
                 f6g5_19 + f1g0 + f3g8_19 + f5g6_19 + f7g4_19;
    int64_t h2 = f6g6_19 + f8g4_19 + f0g2 + f2g0 + f4g8_19 +
                 f1g1_2 + f3g9_38 + f5g7_38 + f7g5_38 + f9g3_38;
    // It repeats like this until h9

    // And then like from previous, the modules shift will be adjusted.
    // i.e., All carry[i] adjustments happens here

    // Using them finally stored into returned variable.
    
    h[0] = (int32_t) h0;
    h[1] = (int32_t) h1;
    // Continue this process until h[9]

    // Ending of Program and function.
}


Notice that overall functionality of function is still same, as we've re arranged the terms considering associative property of Multiplication(which don't affects result). The only difference is the order of Computation differs from original one. All computations performed are same like in initialization of integers for Multiples or calling recursive multiplication of terms inside the arrays or the recursive halving(carry adjustments), all of that implemented functions are similar from original.
