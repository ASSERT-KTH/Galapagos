This variant will handle NULL pointer exception that may occur in the current implementation and check if "_misuse_handler" points at an existing function before running it. Further, usage of "abort()" function directly is preferred as it provides more context to crash investigation with metrics, associated debug info with the provided code.

        if (_misuse_handler != NULL) {
            void (*handler)(void) = _misuse_handler;
            handler();
        }
        else {
            fberror("Fatal crash - the '_misuse_handler' function pointer is NULL.\n");
            raise(SIGTERM);   // Raises SIGTERM signal, then if no SIGTERM handler installed handles clean up and kill the process.
        }

     Invoke abort directly
    It generates a SIGABRT signal, dumps core for post mortem analysis, and actually
    guarantees your program ends. 
    
    It helps if the clean up was important or
    needs a shot at debugging you into automatic reboots, etc.
    The blame for this brutal way lies pretty nearly in "exit".
