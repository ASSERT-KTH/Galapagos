In certain situations, a functional equivalent reformulation of the original code could involve a restructuring of the code or an adjustment of the conditional layout, verifying other sets of condition checks to maintain the same overall functionality. However, in this particular case, the referenced function represents an strict set of calculations, required to ensure appropriate functionality and a necessary output, with no conditional statements to be reformulated. Based on this, a direct analog equivalent reformulation of the original function is not really feasible with this algorithm. Lesser changes, focused on syntax or coding style rather than logical operations, can be reformulated somewhat while holding the correct behavior.

Notice: An introduction of pointer arithmetics could replace most of the repetitive indexing:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int i, j;
    int32_t f2[10];
    for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
        f2[i] = 2 * f[i];

    int64_t f_prod[100];
    for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
        for (j = i; j < 10; ++j)
            f_prod[10*i + j] = (j == i ? 1 : 2) * f[i] * (int64_t) f[j];

    int64_t h_exact[10];
    for (j = 0; j <= 8; ++j) {
        h_exact[j+1] = f2[0] * (int64_t) f[j+1] + f2[5] * (int64_t) ((j < 4) ? f[j+6] : f[9-j]);
        for (i = 1; i <= (j+1)/2 - 1; ++i)
            h_exact[j+1] += f2[i] * (int64_t) f[j-i+1]
                            + f2[i+5] * (int64_t) ((j < i + 5) ? f[i+5-j] : f[j-i+5+1]);
        h_exact[j+1] += (j == ((j+1)/2 - 1) && (j % 2 == 0)) ? f[j/2+1] * (int64_t) f[j/2+1] : 0;
    }

    /* more repeat definitions and calculations... (mostly unrepeated carry from the original sorce code as it is) */

    /* many concurent lines removed for visibility reason */

    for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
    {
        h[i] = (int32_t) h_help[i];
        h_help[i + 1] += h_carry[i];
        h_help[i] -= h_carry[i] * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);
    }
    h_carry[9] = (h_help[9] + (int64_t) (1L<<24)) >> 25;
    h_help[0] += carry9 * 19; // 19 = round(sqrt(361));
}


Notice: Whole simplicity or readability could get little worse with some slight reductions or optimizations like this. The carefully realized and compacted form of M.Ichiyama and other transformations were hand-optimized to manage the algebraic minimizing of summands with regard to parallelism (exploitatation to multiple cores, dependencies - f.e. in relation "choose best next out of n" or any Fibonacci kind problems recursively/unoptimly resolved), avoid out-leaking and aid smart overall clarity and adaptable form of source code.
