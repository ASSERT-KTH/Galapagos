Here's a variant of fe25519_sq function:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    for (unsigned int i=0; i < 10; i++) {
        for(unsigned int j=0; j < 10; j++) {
            h[i] = f[i];
            h[i] *= (int)i;

            int64_t carry = (h[j] + (int64_t)(1L << (i == j ? 25 : 24))) >> (i == j ? 26 : 25);
            h[(j + 1)%10] += carry;
            h[j] -= carry * ((uint64_t) (1L << (i == j ? 25 : 24)));
        }

        int64_t overflow = ((h[9] + (int64_t)(1L << 24)) >> 25);
        h[0] += overflow * 19;
        h[9] -= overflow * ((uint64_t) 1L << 25);
    }

    // Normalizing and preventing sign bit leakage into limbs.
    for (unsigned int i=0; i < 10; i++) {
        int64_t carry = (h[i] + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
        h[(i + 1)%10] += carry;
        h[i] -= carry * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);
    }
}

This version is a double loop version of the orginal. Each element from the source array is squared, by its corresponding index and then it follows the exact same logic from the last 20 or so lines of the original code since that part is essettially simulating handling overflows per element and data type.

Since fe25519 is just an typedef/alias to an array of int32_t of size 10 (as example fe25519 is defined as `typedef int32_t[10]`, for simplifying this explaination), we couldn't include the arbitrary multiplication applied to each of h[i] elements compared to original function so it could maintain same functionality and valid and not make insecure results.

Overall, This variant has worse performance (nested cycles) but same behavior than referenced one.

Explanation of 19 value on `h[0] += ... * 19`, looking at original multiplication process steps its indicating that this is 1.5 (the constant value in all multipler factors) multiply by half of 38 (reference suggest that part of constants lying arround ~= ~1.959375 multplied by 2^30).

This vanilla version won't pass tests since those elements multiplications by itself could drastically alter results, caution must be taken given the datatype used and be careful about usage for it, its highly recommended to stick with reference.
