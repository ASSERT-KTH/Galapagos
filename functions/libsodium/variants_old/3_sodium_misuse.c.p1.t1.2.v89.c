This C code carefully modifies the function behavior by including an error log message within the function, complementing its existing functionality.


#include <stdio.h>

sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL) {
            fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: Sodium misuse detected\n");
            handler();
        }
    }

    fputs("ERROR: Critical failure, program will now abort.\n", stderr);

    abort();
}


Please be aware that using side effects like logging in critical sections (such as between `sodium_crit_enter` and `sodium_crit_leave`) could potentially lead to compilation errors or unintended behavior in thread-safe code, depending on the implementation of `sodium_crit_enter`, `sodium_crit_leave`, and `_misuse_handler`. Always be sure to consider thread safety when working with critical sections for fail-safe results.
