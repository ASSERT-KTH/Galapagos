This variant modifies some multiplications of the original function with 19 to 38, and vice versa for, potentially speeding-up an arithmetic operation, apart from producing different sets of sub-results (e.g., variables `f1876` versus `f1819`). This does, overall, different operations as compared to the original unit of work, but only produces as result `h` also performing some different arithmetic shrinkings/canonicalising for similar, final output/results.
