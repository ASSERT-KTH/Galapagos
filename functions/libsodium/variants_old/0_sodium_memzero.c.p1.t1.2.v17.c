Here's a program variant with similar functionality. Instead of implementing several specific conditional checks for window memory zeroing functions and Unix spec style functions, this variant only employs memset. This is universally available across both Windows and Unix-like systems, meaning it's fully portably across a broad range of system types.


#include <string.h>

void sodium_memzero(void * const pnt, const size_t len) {
    if (pnt == NULL || len == 0)
        return;
    
    memset(pnt, 0, len);
}


This function first checks if either the pointer is NULL or the length is zero, returning instantly if either is true. In cases where both checks fail (i.e., we have a valid non-null pointer and a non-zero length), we use memset to zero out the memory.

The functionality of zeroing out the memory remains preserved, but some of the original function's conditional system specification functionality is lost. Overall, the behavior should be effectively identical in terms of primary functionality but may vary slightly upon system specifics.

It is essential to remember that memset might be optimized away by the compiler under certain circumstances. The nuances of 'volatile' declarations and careful assembly instructions utilized in the first variant aren't present in this variation. Therefore, if those particulars are necessary, you might want to stick to the original function. 

This simple version should suffice for common usage if those spec-details aren't a concern.
