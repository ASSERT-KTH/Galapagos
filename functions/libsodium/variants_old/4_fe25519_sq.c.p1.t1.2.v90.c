Here's an equivalent program with behavior different from the previous one. Instead of using multiple distinct integer multiplies and combines code blocks with conditions:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{   
    int32_t i, j;
    int64_t carry[10] = {0}, h_temp[10] = {0}, f_dec[10] = {0}, f2_dec[10] = {0}, tmp;

    // Make a copy of the elements of f and its double value and store these inside arrays.
    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        f_dec[i] = f[i];
        f2_dec[i] = 2 * f[i];
    }

    // Pre-calculate few constants
    f2_dec[8] *= 19;
    f2_dec[9] = 38 * f[9];
    f2_dec[1] = f2_dec[1] * 38;
    f2_dec[2] = f2_dec[2] * 19;
    f2_dec[5] = f2_dec[5] * 38;
    f2_dec[6] = 38 * f[6];
    f2_dec[7] = 19 * f[7];

    // Calculate value of h_temp[i] sequentially.
    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        for(j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            // Should use specifically multiply by what ?
            tmp = (j == i || (j+i)%2 == 0) ? 2*f_dec[j]*f_dec[i-j] : f2_dec[j]*f_dec[i-j];

            // Should perform another addition at some specific condition ?
            tmp = ((j == i) || (j*2 == i)) ?  tmp : tmp + h_temp[i] ;

            h_temp[i] = tmp;
        }
    }

    // Calculate values of carry
    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        carry[i] = ((int64_t)(1L << (((i%2)?24:25) + ((i < 2)?0:1))) + h_temp[i])  >> (((i%2)?24:25) + ((i < 2)?0:1) + 1);
	h_temp[i] += ((int64_t)(1L << (((i%2)?24:25) + ((i < 2)?0:1))) - (carry[i] * ((uint64_t) (1L << (((i%2)?24:25) + ((i < 2)?0:1) + 1))));
	h_temp[i+1] += carry[i];

	// add a particualar value to carry[9] and h0 accordingly at specific condition
	if(i == 8){
	    carry[9] = (h_temp[9] + (int64_t)(1L << 24)) >> 25;
            h_temp[0] += carry[9] * 19;
            h_temp[9] -= carry[9] * ((uint64_t) 1L << 25);
	}
    }

     // add final extra carry to last element
    carry[0] = (h_temp[0] + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
    h_temp[1] += carry[0];
    h_temp[0] -= carry[0] * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);


    // copy back to result
    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        h[i] = (int32_t) h_temp[i];
   }
}


This code performs the same results with the original function. It has the same outputs. However, control flow has been changed; re-implementation of same logic with less repetitive instructions.
However, this style of code should be used with caution and clear documentation, as clarity may be slightly compromised due to many repetitions and intricate conditional statements.
