This variant of the function maintains the same behavior while presenting some of its logic through a loop. This does lead to slightly more complex expressions. Here's how it goes C-style:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int32_t fi[10];
    int32_t fi_2[8];
    int64_t h_values[10];
    int64_t carry[10];
    int64_t temp_product;

    // TODO: Your initialization logic needs to be updated to set all
    // elements of carry to 0, as well as initialize all h_values to 0.

    int f_mult[5] = {38, 19, 38, 19, 38};

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        fi[i] = f[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        fi_2[i] = 2 * fi[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            temp_product = (uint64_t)fi[j] * (i==j ? fi[j] : fi_2[i-j]);
            // Manual adjustment for the values
            if (j > 4)
                temp_product *= f_mult[j-5];
            else if (i!=j)
                temp_product = temp_product / 2UL;
            h_values[i] += temp_product;
        }

        // Additional computation over h based on original
        if (i <= 4)
          h_values[2 * i] += (uint64_t)fi[i+5] * fi_2[5] * f_mult[i];

        carry[i] = (h_values[i] + (1L << (26 - (i % 2)))) >> (25 + (i % 2));
        if (i < 9) {
          h_values[i+1] += carry[i];
          h_values[i] -= carry[i] * ((uint64_t)1L << (25 + (i % 2)));          
        } else {
          h_values[0] += carry[i] * 19;
          h_values[i] -= carry[i] << 25;
          carry[0] = (h_values[0] + (int64_t)(1 << 25)) >> 26;
          h_values[1] += carry[0];
          h_values[0] -= carry[0] << 26;
        }
        if (i < 9)
          h[i] = (int32_t)h_values[i];
    }
    h[9] = (int32_t)h_values[9];
}


This modification tries to integrate most of the calculations within nested loops. Keep in mind that some operations that were separate in the original formula due to their unusual factorization compared to the iteration run, are pulled within loop executions guarded/compensated by specific conditions.
Again, the comments contain incomplete considerations and bear open tasks that ought to be suitably addressed before making an actual use of the function.
Comment indentation plus body suggest position directly within the `fe25519_sq()` function. Readability and efficiency is a constant balance!
The seemingly redundant pass over `fi[]` setup is one example towards optimizing unit space: Having direct accesses in favor of serving indexer permutations between `fi[]` or `f[]`. Saving twenty ops within highly executed code routines, while costing function local memory space for extended use, possibly with further benefits observable during indexer arithmetic simplification, qualify for essential attention.

Original values of `fi_2[]` over "9" and `f_mult[]` numbers could be regenerated on context unless optimization verily spares value recreation for looping condition, thus potentially saving one `int32_t`. Operator wise it might even not help so much as to merit reduced expenditure.

Lastly, note that accuracy of operations and the essential function purpose should conform with errors smaller than one in one billion (10 `fp9`), possibly even three orders more accurate.
