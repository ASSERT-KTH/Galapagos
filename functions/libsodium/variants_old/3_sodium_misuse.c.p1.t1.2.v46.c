The following code preserves the original functionality of the function, but changes its behavior by adding a null handler case and error logging in case of unhandled behavior:


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();

    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;

        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
        } else {
            printf("Error: No handler specified\n"); // null handler case
            return;
        }
    } else {
        printf("Error: Sodium crit enter failed\n"); // aberrant behavior
    }
    abort(); // point of no return in case function fails to fulfill its end
}

It's important to notice that extra work will be needed as implicit in the task. Above program will no print anything in console, which could break test cases. Defining DEBUG_MODE macro, or whether a preferred way to control program accordingly to running circumstances would be preferred.
