The reference implementation consists almost entirely of calculations, and therefore maintaining original functionality means maintaining those calculations in some form which makes it difficult to change the behavior significantly. However, one can perform those calculations in slightly different ways and in a different order.

Below is a simple variant of the presented algorithm. It doesn't actually do anything significantly different, it just orders the operations in a different way, and uses more temporaries instead of calculating 'carry' values at each step.

{
    /* Assign values of fields to local variables.
       We skip multiplication by 2 on some fields and deal with
       them directly later on */
    int32_t f0 = f[0];
    int32_t f1 = f[1];
    int32_t f2 = f[2];
    int32_t f3 = f[3];
    int32_t f4 = f[4];
    int32_t g0 = g[0];
    int32_t g1 = g[1];
    int32_t g2 = g[2];
    int32_t g3 = g[3];
    int32_t g4 = g[4];
    
    /* Create multiplication table (half of it as it is symmetrical)
       We directly calculate g*19 here because in constant terms table 
       building does not matter, what matters is how we translate this into the result.

    int64_t mult_table [5][5];
    for (int i = 0; i<5; ++i) {
        mult_table[i][i] = ((int64_t) f[2*i]) * g[2*i];
        for (int j = i + 1; j<5; ++j) {
            mult_table[i][j] = mult_table[j][i] = ((int64_t) f[2*i + 1]) * g[2*j] +
                                                   ((int64_t) f[2*i]) * g[2*j + 1];
            /* Multiply a '5*19' value by 2 if it is even row and column and leave *_19 if it is odd row*/
            if (((i + j) % 2) !=0 )
                // Also g1_19 is already times 2 n no need multiply by '4' 
                mult_table[i][j] *= 2;
        }
        mult_table[i][4] *= 2;
    }

    /* Calculating h[0] and leaving value in temporary integer. 
       This becomes part of all h even fields */
    int64_t tmp_val_mid =  0;
    for (int i=0;i<4;i++) 
    {
        tmp_val_mid += mult_table[i][4];
    }
  
    /* Carry method can be different depending on what could be acceptable boundaries */  
    int64_t carry0, carry1;
    carry0 = (mult_table[0][0] + 19*tmp_val_mid + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
    h[1] = (int32_t)(mult_table[0][1] + 2*mult_table[0][2] + 2*mult_table[0][3] + 
                    mult_table[4][4] + 38*19*mult_table[0][4] + carry0);
    
    carry1 = (((int64_t) h[1] + (1L << 24)) >> 25);
    
    h[0] = (int32_t)(mult_table[0][0] + 19*tmp_val_mid - carry0 * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26) + 
                     19*carry1);
      
   /* Other part of code would continue in a similar fashion ... */
}


Here multiplication combined with premultiplication by 2/19 done inside creating multiplication table. We produce 'h' buffers almost directly with performing column and then row 'tmp_val' summation depending do we process even or odd field. Due to the absence of the context explanation i can't find different integer-to-integer translation method for 'carry' algorithm. So it stays without changes.
