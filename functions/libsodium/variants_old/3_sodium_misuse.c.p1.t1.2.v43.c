The following program variant rolls the code functionalities while using different structures and maintains the original role of the given function with the same signature. Instead of including a direct attribute to the created pointer variable, it follows a different sequence of condition validation and adds some standard output indications for the operation process of the functions:


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    /* Initialization of function pointer */
    void (*handler)(void) = _misuse_handler;
    
    /* Trying to enter a critical region */
    int entry_status = sodium_crit_enter();

    /* Entered the critical region */
    if (entry_status == 0) {
        /* sodium chronology inversed */
        (void) sodium_crit_leave();

        /* check if misuse handler is initiated */
        if (_misuse_handler != NULL) {
            /* call to the misuse_handler() with the pointer returned by _misuse_handler assigned to handler pointer */
            handler();
        }
        else {
            /* if _misuse_handler is not initiated */
            fprintf(stderr, "Error: _misuse_handler is not set.\n");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }
    
    /* Failing to enter critical region would initiate an abort */
    else {
        /* sending with LCOV_EXCL_START the issue path f print */
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: could not enter critical region\n");
        abort();
    }
}
 

Finally, this code also includes diagnostic text outputs and failure-safety by adding exit status and message indications using CÂ´s standard I/O library `stdio`.
