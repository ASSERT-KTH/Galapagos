You can rearrange the calculations performed in this function, and change variable assignments slightly, while maintaining the functionality of the function. Here is one potential program variant:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g) 
{
    const uint64_t mask = 0x7ffffffffffffULL;
    uint128_t r[5], f_[5], g_[5];
    uint64_t res[5], carry;

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        f_[i] = f[i];
        g_[i] = g[i];
    }

    f_[1] *= 19;
    f_[2] *= 19;
    f_[3] *= 19;
    f_[4] *= 19;

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        r[i] = f_[0] * g_[i] + f_[1] * g_[(i + 4) % 5] + f_[2] * g_[(i + 3) % 5] + f_[3] * g_[(i + 2) % 5] + f_[4] * g_[(i + 1) % 5];
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        res[i] = (uint64_t)(r[i]) & mask;
        carry = (uint64_t)(r[i] >> 51);
        
        if( i != 4 ) {
            r[i + 1] += carry;
        } else {
            res[0] += 19ULL * carry;
        }

        carry = res[i] >> 51;
        res[i] &= mask;

        if( i != 4 ) {
            res[i + 1] += carry;
        }
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        h[i] = res[i];
    }
}

The above code basically does the same thing as the original code but using iteration which reduces the code repetitions. I've used positioning relative to the current index in the loop to accomplish the equivalent functionality to shifting through arrays `f` and `g` that was performed in the original function. To maintain the flow of carry from the position of `res[i]` to `res[i+1]`, I manipulated the loop structure.
