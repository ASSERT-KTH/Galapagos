Here's a possible variant of the function that accomplishes the intended task:

void sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void) = NULL;

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
  
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0 && _misuse_handler != NULL) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        handler();
    }
    
    abort(); 
}

In this variant, instead of directly assigning `_misuse_handler` to the `handler` pointer, we first check whether `_misuse_handler` is `NULL` in the `if` statement condition itself. Only when `_misuse_handler` is not `NULL`, it is assigned to `handler` and the function is directly called. This avoids the `NULL` check that was separately performed in the original function thereby possibly saving one extra condition check every time this function is called. However please be aware that depending on how your compiler optimizes code, there may not be any significant performance improvement. This code variant communicates a certain coding style preference (i.e., compactness of IF statements).
All use of the ‘sodium_crit’ functions is kept intact making sure still handles critical errors efficiently and `abort` is called irrespective of other conditions maintaining the original functionality of running clean up routines/abnormal process termination as in the original system implementation.
