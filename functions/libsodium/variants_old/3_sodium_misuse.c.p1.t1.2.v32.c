Here is a variant of the function that adds an additional check for some_condition() in the if-construct while essentially maintaining the overall functionality of the original sodium_misuse() function.


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL && some_condition()) {
            handler();
        }
    }
/* LCOV_EXCL_START */
    if (!some_condition()){
        abort();
    }
}


In this function, the call to `handler()` and `abort()` are dependent on the function `some_condition()`.  When `some_condition()` returns true, the function operates exactly as the original does, but if `some_condition()` returns false, `handler()` doesn't call and `abort()` will call â€“ a behavior not found in the original function.

Note that `some_condition()` is a placeholder for a function which determines the condition under which the `handler()` is to be called and `abort()` to be stopped. Replace with the correct function based on the context in your use case.
