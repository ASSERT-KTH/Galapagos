Here is a variant of the code. This shows how the input test begins inside critical section, checks if handler is set, calls it, and then ends critical section.


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
        }
    }
    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    /* LCOV_EXCL_START */
    abort();
}


The substituted variant retains the original functionality but includes a slight modification in logic. Now, while entering the critical section first, the function checks that the misuse handler is set not null and handles it, then the critical section finishes after. It should result in comparable functionality to the original, maintaining threat protection expectations based on misuse_handler actions within the crucial section and finishing the crucial section after at last. As in the original function implementation, there should be no return values; if misuse_handler doesn't take any preventative action, it will result in an immediate abort as specified.
