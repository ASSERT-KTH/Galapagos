This slight change in variable names and controlling the process of assigning values to the final output (h[k]) might be insignificant when considering the large-scale encryption embedding it might serve in, but it could create slightly different process outputs which still correctly functions as specified.
Even the final calculation executing right before each assignation line can affect timings on minute scales, which might possibly shake up electrical patterns if the device's transistors and help thwart high-effort, yet narrowly cunning invasive hardware attacks.
