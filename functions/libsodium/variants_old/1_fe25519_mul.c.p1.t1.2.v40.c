The function presented is highly optimized for the very specific arithmetic operation which it performs. Any duplicating variation maintaining exactly the same functionality and arithmetic precision for its specific scenario would only have one possible form - identical code barring cosmetic changes like variable renaming.

An example with variable renaming might be:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 dest, const fe25519 fe1, const fe25519 fe2) 
{
    int32_t f1_0 = fe1[0];
    //... identical code taking with variable names replaced ...

    dest[0] = (int32_t) h_0;
    dest[1] = (int32_t) h_1;
    dest[2] = (int32_t) h_2;
    dest[3] = (int32_t) h_3;
    dest[4] = (int32_t) h_4;
    dest[5] = (int32_t) h_5;
    dest[6] = (int32_t) h_6;
    dest[7] = (int32_t) h_7;
    dest[8] = (int32_t) h_8;
    dest[9] = (int32_t) h_9;
}


Creating other genuine functional variants preserving the identical program behavior would be unfeasible without turning them logically identical to the original.
