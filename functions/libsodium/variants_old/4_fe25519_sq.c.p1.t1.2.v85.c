With this approach, it ensures that the large product computations are moved inside a loop significantly simplifying the code readability and maintainability. As well as multiplying certain elements by specific constants are placed inside a simple loop. However, it is important to cross check about the correctness of solution and integrate unit test accordingly. This approach is also ready to be optimized to significantly reduce the cycles it will take if performing operation many times on a large datasets.
