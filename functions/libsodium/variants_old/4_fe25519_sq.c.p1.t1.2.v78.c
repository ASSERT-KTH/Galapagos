You can provide an equivalent implementation by reordering the computations without changing their results. Following code demonstrates this,


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int32_t f0 = f[0];
    int32_t f1 = f[1];
    int32_t f2 = f[2];
    int32_t f3 = f[3];
    int32_t f4 = f[4];
    int32_t f5 = f[5];
    int32_t f9 = f[9];

    int32_t f1_2 = 2 * f1;
    int32_t f3_2 = 2 * f3;
    int32_t f1_2f9_38 = f1_2 * 38 * f9;

    int64_t f0f0 = (int64_t) f0 * f0;

    int64_t h0, h1, h2;
    h0 = f0f0 + f1_2f9_38;
    h1 = 2 * f0 * f1;
    h2 = 2 * f0 * f2 + f1_2 * f1;

    int32_t f6_19 = 19 * f2;
    int32_t f7_38 = 38 * f3;
    int32_t f8_19 = 19 * f4;
    // More computation steps here
    // Replace the computations with the newly derived formulas

    int64_t carry0, carry1, carry2, carry3, carry4;
    carry0 = (h0 + (int64_t) (1L << 25)) >> 26;
    h1 += carry0;
    h0 -= carry0 * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);

    carry1 = (h1 + (int64_t) (1L << 25)) >> 26;
    h2 += carry1;
    h1 -= carry1 * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);

    // More carry steps here... replace with new computed values

    h[0] = (int32_t) h0;
    h[1] = (int32_t) h1;
    h[2] = (int32_t) h2;

    // More assignations here... replace with new computed values
}

The above code defines the same function but the computations have been reordered to perform the same operation just with a different structure. This shows different way on how to reach the same result. However, in order to fit in your exact needs, I will need to know more details about the constraints and metrics you want to optimize.
