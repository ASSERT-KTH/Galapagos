In Go, we can't exactly maintain the same function signature because Go and C have different syntax and conventions for defining functions and their parameters. Also, the exact equivalent really depends on how you are handling randomness in your Go implementation. But regarding these, we can still roughly implement it as a function in Go:



go
import "crypto/rand"

func randombytesBuf(buf []byte) {
	if len(buf) > 0 {
		_, _ = rand.Read(buf)
	}
}


Hope you understand that there is not an interface called `implementation` from which we could call another `buf()` function, also, Go rules out implicit casting, initialized variable enforcement (`randombytes_init_if_needed`), and `void * const` -- here replaces by `[]byte`. 

Hence this simple yet effective version picks an crypto/rand reader to generate cryptographically secure pseudo-random bytes sequence. Also Go handles errors distinctly from C, this snippet omits error handling and it depends on specific audience to tailor proper handling steps.
