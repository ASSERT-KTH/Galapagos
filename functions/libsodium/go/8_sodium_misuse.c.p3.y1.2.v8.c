Since Go doesn't support function pointers in the same way as C, the Go equivalent function would use interface type to achieve a similar result. But without knowing what `sodium_crit_leave`, `sodium_crit_enter`, `_misuse_handler`, and `abort` are supposed to do precisely, I assumed in the sample provided below, that `sodium_crit_leave` and `sodium_crit_enter` are just critical parts or features to check some details and then considered these points as bool types features, `_misuse_handler` is a standard function in your program (let's say it just print something in our example), and `abort` is an exit command. I modified it accordingly:

Go
type MisuseHandler interface {
    Execute()
}

type Handler struct {}

func (h *Handler) Execute() {
    fmt.Println("Misuse Handler Executed")
}

var _misuse_handler = &Handler{}

func sodiumMisuse(handler MisuseHandler) {
    sodiumCritLeave := false
    sodiumCritEnter := true

    if !sodiumCritLeave && sodiumCritEnter {
        if handler != nil {
            handler.Execute()
        }
    }
    os.Exit(1)
}


Here, `MisuseHandler` interface has an `Execute()` method, which is implemented by `Handler` type, `_misuse_handler` is created with the type `Handler` and `sodiumMisuse()` accepts `MisuseHandler` type argument which is the interface type, if it is not `nil` then it calls its method `Execute()`. If `sodiumCritLeave` and `sodiumCritEnter` breakage happens then it calls `os.Exit(1)` considering that as `abort()`. Again it is a lot speculation as it based many assumptions.
