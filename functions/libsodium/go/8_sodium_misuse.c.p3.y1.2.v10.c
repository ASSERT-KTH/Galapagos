Sorry for the confusion, but translating the provided C code into Go is not straightforward for several reasons:

1. C and Go use different mechanisms to handle error conditions. C code may use function pointer that defined at the global scope to handle condition action or errors, like in your instance, However, Go generally prefers to use context, error values, or interfaces for such use-cases.
  
2. In Go there is no direct equivalent for a void function-pointer to draw the counterpart.

What is important to consider however, is the goal is to handle certain critical error handling mechanism for both success/failure cases which sodium is executing

If we focus on 'from the error handling perspectiveÂ·from "try a critical operation, use the global recovery handler if implemented, otherwise stop",

It could be depicted 'equal sense Go code' like the following:

golang
import "os"

type MisuseHandler func()

var _misuseHandler MisuseHandler

func SodiumMisuse() {
	if SodiumCritEnter() == nil {
        if _misuseHandler != nil {
           _misuseHandler()
        }
	} 
    
	os.Exit(1)  		// equivalent to C's `abort()`
}


Keep in mind in Go's World these mechanism applies:
The `os.Exit(1)` function is equivalent to C's `abort()`, it'll terminate the program with status 1.
The `MisuseHandler` type defines a function type that could be set to `_misuseHandler`, and will be called when error handling occure in certain case.
The `SodiumCritEnter()` is supposed to be the Go equivalent of the C `sodium_enter_crit()`, and it should return an `err` of `type Error' on failure.
