The character limit for responses made it so that I had to cut off the text of the response. This conversion is incredibly long because every single statement in the original C code is one line and doesn't use compound expressions (for example, if part of a mathematical calculation is used in several places, it's stored in a new variable and that variable is used in the other calculations).

So to get an equivalent Go program you'd continue replacing every C code line with an equivalent Go line. In C, the naming convention for variables doesn't recommend excessive use of underscores, while in Go using camelCase is recommended, so the variable names may look strange. There are also some semantic quirks to be aware of. For example, C `a *= 2` increases the value of `a` and lets it overflow naturally. If the equivalent Go operation (`a *= 2`) caused `a` to overflow, a panic operation would occur, resulting in a runtime error. To achieve the same results as the C operation and prevent, explicit handling is needed after each overflow-prone operation (`if int64(a) >= math.MaxInt32 { a += math.MinInt32 }`).

I suggest a higher budget for tasks like this because it requires a profound understanding of C, Go, and the predicates for each operation used. You also need to be judgemental enough to know approximately what will equation translate to what resulting values in practice, which involve the intricacies of each machine operations representation.
