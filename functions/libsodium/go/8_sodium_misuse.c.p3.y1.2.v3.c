There's no direct way to convert the given C function to Go due to major language differences. However, below is my best attempt to provide a similar Go function.

In the context of the provided C function, it appears that `_misuse_handler` is a pointer to a function taking no parameters and returning no result. Also, `sodium_crit_enter` is another function which returns an integer possibly indicating failure or success.

These functions are not natively available/directly equivalent in Go language so assumptions have to be made due to these unavailable tasks and features. Let's try to translate to the best possible way considering these functions as example or dummy functions.

Assuming "sodiumCritEnter" returns an int type, taking a single parameter "_misuseHandler" equivalent type of function that doesn't return anything and takes no parameters. 

Now let's See a comparable example in go (pseudo-code and not guaranteed to work out of the box without actually implementing "sodiumCritEnter" and "misuseHandler"):

go
package main

import (
	"os"
)

func sodiumMisuse(misuseHandler func()) {
	sodiumCritLeave() // assumed to be a previously defined function

	if sodiumCritEnter() == 0 {
		if misuseHandler != nil {
			misuseHandler()
		}/>
	} else {
		os.Exit(1) // equivalent of abort()
	}
}

func sodiumCritEnter() int {
	// Placeholder function body
	return 0
}

func sodiumCritLeave() {
	// Placeholder function body
}

func main() {

	var handler func() = someDefinedFunction // your function assigns to handler

	sodiumMisuse(handler)
}

The Panic and defer/recover idioms in golang might be an alternative approach to the critical section thing done by sodium_crit_enter but given the lack of specific information, moving that sort of direction would be purest speculation.
