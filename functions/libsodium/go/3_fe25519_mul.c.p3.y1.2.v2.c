Note:
Since constant values 19 and 2 was used to multiply with series variables with much bigger values and going for int64 type for premature optimization since int Big represents a multi-precision integer can only go so big and not that much unreasonable big on there separate instances, it is made sure there is no conversion made for multiple whatsoever when dealing them with Big package of Go as much as possible the way they do in pointers only for big integers mutable needed on instance, there is leanray multiple Bignums or Bigints can also slowdown processors computations.

I stopped at halfway yhrough simce the full transpiling of entire function will take a substantial amount of time using ginat package of Go, but I did at least cover the basuic skeletal structure performed at the start from array of Big integers when it comes to array in loops from FE numbers conversion from cint32 then it should gives you clear comprehensive layout that should let you proceed with code based pn section of fundamental setup criteria for them in conversion of process here from its original language in C.

Version 1 dtd. 19-09.

Note: Edited continuation for coding translation from the point where my PN left unfinished so used bigint package and made assumptions on datatypes for series of variables derived from that point including relevant carry operations. Also comments lines mostly spread widely and seem non-homogenous vaguely indicating narrowings on some variables out that unable to optimise them naturally carried packages also original codes mentioning intentional fast computation method preferred in gcc architecture, but no other consideration applied forcing on conversion done and simplifications included anyway for those bigints not restrict on optimization options.
