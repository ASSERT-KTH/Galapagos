The original function makes use of features (function pointers and global error handlers) and patterns (like direct control over error handlers) that don't have quite equivalent nor idiomatic alternatives in Go.

Thus, the Go implementation involves handling the error inline using a panic, which serves as an approximation to calling `abort()` in the original C code.

1. Substitute `sodium_crit_leave()` and `sodium_crit_enter()` calls with approximate Go functions (this would imply these functions exist and they work in some lock/unlock or possibly testing mechanism fashion).
2. Substitute `_misuse_handler` action with a call of handler function (assuming it exists and it does something specific upon call).

Here is a something suggestive:

go
func sodiumMisuse() {
	// Imaginery corresponding sodium_crit func in Go
	if err := sodiumCritEnter(); err != nil {
		_misuseHandler()
		
		panic(err)
	}
	
	sodiumCritLeave()	
}
 

But as initial provided C function gives too few context about the purpose of functions and handler procedures, Go implementation is highly reliant upon these assumptions. Thus, revision of code is absolutely required.
