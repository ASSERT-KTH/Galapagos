In Go, we cannot proceed exactly as we did in C (primarily due to the lack of pointers to functions, differing exit mechanisms, type assertion and unique error handling). Moreover, in Go there isn't straightforward equivalent of Sodium library's functions sodium_crit_enter() and sodium_crit_leave(). However there can be workarounds. Usually when concurrency and critical sections come into play in Go, channels, goroutines, or the "sync" package are involved. 

Trying to keep things less complex this code tries to resemble the C function as closely possibly keeping in mind Go's safer constructs and paradigms:

go
import (
	"errors"
	"os"
)

var handler func() = nil

func sodiumMisuse() {
	defer os.Exit(1) // os.Exit(1) or panic(1) can be equivalent to abort() in C
	
	err := sodiumCritLeave()
	if err != nil {
		return		
	}

	if sodiumCritEnter() == nil {
		if handler != nil {
			handler()
		}
	}
}
 
func sodiumCritLeave() error {
   // Assuming you have implemented sodiumCritLeave() and sodiumCritEnter() that should return an error
   return errors.New("failed")
}


func sodiumCritEnter() error {
	// Assuming you have implemented sodiumCritLeave() and sodiumCritEnter() that should return an error
   return nil
}

The sodiumCritEnter() and sodiumCritLeave() functions are not implemented here, as they seems to be external dependencies. In Go we usually use error to assert if an operation succeeded or not, hence these C equivalents in Go will return an error. They wonâ€™t translate to Go directly off Python due to Go being statically typed. With more context on how sodiumCritEnter() and sodiumCritLeave() are operating, a more accurate representation can be achieved.

To achieve the behavior in the original code, where if handler === nil results in calling abort(), in Go it might make more sense to just do nothing when this is the case. In fact "not doing nothing" would violate its errcheck as well as against Go idioms. At right side of these Go implemenations is context about handler. What happens when it's nil? If nil means failure, just set handler to a default function printing an error message and then exiting with fail. With that, if sodiumCritEnter returns err, allows to proceed to handler call, which "cannot not run".
