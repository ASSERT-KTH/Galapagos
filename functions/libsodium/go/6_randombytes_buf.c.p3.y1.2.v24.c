Since Go does not support default methods in objects like in C, and the 'implementations' struct and its method 'buf' remain unknown, below is a simple adaptation using Go's "crypto/rand" package. 

go
import "crypto/rand"

func RandomBytesBuf(buf []byte, size uint) {
    if size > 0 {
        rand.Read(buf[:size])
    }
}

This function would fill first 'size' elements of 'buf' slice with random bytes from crypto/rand package. To populate the entire 'buf' with random bytes, use 'buf' without the range (:size). This implements substitution of both 'randombytes_init_if_needed' and 'implementation->buf(buf, size)' of the original function but does not guarantee exact same functionality, due to missing parts of the original code. Please adapt it according to your use case.
