Assumptions: 
1- Here I am assuming that `randombytes_init_if_needed()` call is to initialize your random byte generator if it is not already initialized, and this update can be reasonably possible with `sync.Once`.
2- `implementation->buf(buf, size)` call rather isn't standardized and I would simulate it with Go's `math/rand` library for this illustration.
   
Understanding: Function fills buffer "buf" of "size" size with random bytes.

Having stated these assumptions, here we go with our Go function:

go
import (
     "math/rand"
     "sync"
     "time"
)

var once sync.Once

func randomBytesBuf(buf []byte, size int) {
     once.Do(func() {
         rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
     })
     if size > 0 {
         rand.Read(buf[:size])
     }
}
