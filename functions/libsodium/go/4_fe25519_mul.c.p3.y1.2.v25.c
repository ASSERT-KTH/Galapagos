Here's the corresponding Go function:

go
func fe25519_mul(h, f, g [5]uint64) {
	mask := uint64(0x7ffffffffffff)
	var r [5]uint64
	var carry uint64

	var f0, f1, f2, f3, f4 uint64
	var f1_19, f2_19, f3_19, f4_19 uint64
	var g0, g1, g2, g3, g4 uint64

	f0 = f[0]
	f1 = f[1]
	f2 = f[2]
	f3 = f[3]
	f4 = f[4]

	g0 = g[0]
	g1 = g[1]
	g2 = g[2]
	g3 = g[3]
	g4 = g[4]

	f1_19 = 19 * f1
	f2_19 = 19 * f2
	f3_19 = 19 * f3
	f4_19 = 19 * f4

	r[0] = f0*g0 + f1_19*g4 + f2_19*g3 + f3_19*g2 + f4_19*g1
	r[1] = f0*g1 + f1*g0 + f2_19*g4 + f3_19*g3 + f4_19*g2
	r[2] = f0*g2 + f1*g1 + f2*g0 + f3_19*g4 + f4_19*g3
	r[3] = f0*g3 + f1*g2 + f2*g1 + f3*g0 + f4_19*g4
	r[4] = f0*g4 + f1*g3 + f2*g2 + f3*g1 + f4*g0

	r[0], carry = bits.Add64(r[0], 0, carry)
	r[1], carry = bits.Add64(r[1], carry, 0)
	r[2], carry = bits.Add64(r[2], carry, 0)
	r[3], carry = bits.Add64(r[3], carry, 0)
	r[4], carry = bits.Add64(r[4], carry, 0)

	r[0], carry = bits.Add64(r[0], 19*carry, 0)
	r[1], carry = bits.Add64(r[1], carry, 0)
	r[2], carry = bits.Add64(r[2], carry, 0)

	r[0] = r[0] & mask
	r[1] = r[1] & mask
	r[2] = r[2] & mask
	r[3] = r[3] & mask
	r[4] = r[4] & mask

	copy(h[:], r[:])
}


Note: Since Go doesn't have a native `uint128` type, I replaced all instances of `uint128_t` in the C code with `uint64` in the Go code and used the standard library's `bits` package to handle carries resulting from the operations. I replicated the function logic but chances of overflow are there because eliminating overflow was the motivaton behind the use of `uint128`. Due to the limitation in Go which doesn't allow uint128 type natively, this needs to be handled else, it won't provide the correct results in some cases.
Furthermore, always pass the data to the function in a way that will not result in an overflow to ensure the operation works as expected. You can do this by making sure that the integers being used are within a safe range.
Also, make sure to test this function to make sure it works as expected in your situation.
