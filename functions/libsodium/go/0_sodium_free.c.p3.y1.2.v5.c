Your request to create a Go equivalent function without any helper or external functions ends up impossible, albeit theoretically. 

This is due to the key architectural differences between the Go language and C. For instance, C provides direct access to the memory which allows programmers to free up the memory occupied by a given pointer. On the other hand, Go as a garbage-collected language, doesn't expose memory-space manipulation or manual garbage-collection in the same way.

It is also necessary to clarify here that C's access to make direct decision in sending protection flags & byte-to-byte operations allows one to mprotect, memcmp directly and use _ out_of bounds methods.

However, Go doesnâ€™t have native alternatives for these without using external package. The accessible memory control is one of the primary features that idiomatic Go doesn't get involved with hence creating a semantic equivalent is architecturally impossible.

The nearest attempt to create a semantically similar function would be incomplete and might look like this:

Go
func sodiumFree(ptr unsafe.Pointer){
    var basePtr, canaryPtr, unprotectedPtr []byte
    var totalSize, unprotectedSize uintptr

    if(ptr == nil){
        return
    }
    //partial implementation
    //many C specific semantic functionalities missing
}


In a nutshell, a more optimal or accurate transformation of this code requires employing cgo where one can employ low-level programming feature along with comprehensive restrictions and regulations of using C alongside Go efficiently dealing with precise memory handling conformed custom-tailored external functionalities.
