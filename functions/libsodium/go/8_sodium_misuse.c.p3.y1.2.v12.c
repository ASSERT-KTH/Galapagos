Since Go doesn't support function pointers in the same way as C, an interface approach can be employed to achieve semantically similar behavior as the C function.

Go
import (
    "os"
    "sync"
)

type Handler interface {
    Call()
}

var _misuseHandler Handler
var critEnter sync.Mutex

func sodiumMisuse() {
    critEnter.Unlock()
    critEnter.Lock()
    
    if handler := _misuseHandler; handler != nil {
        handler.Call()
    }
    
    // No equivalent to LCOV_EXCL_START hint in Go
    os.Exit(1)
}

Since Go does not support the "volatile" concept in the same way as C, concurrency control for shared data was used. Also, Go does not support abort() like in C, thus we can use os.Exit() instead.
