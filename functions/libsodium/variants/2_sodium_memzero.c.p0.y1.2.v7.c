Here is a brief simplified implementation of the function using the `memset()` function, which should work across most platforms although it's less secure than the original function in some ways due to lack of volatile usage and not considering optimizations which may result in removing me mory clearing in some ocassions. However, the function does maintain signature and generally satisfies the similar function that the present function does:


#include <string.h>

void sodium_memzero(void * const pnt, const size_t len) {
    memset(pnt, 0, len);
}


Keep in mind, the original function takes advantage of various methods to ensure the successful zeroing of memory across a variety of platforms and secure against different forms of attacks or behaviors. UnconditIonally using `memset()` in applications where security is a significant concern should not substitute without proper knowledge of consequences/behaviors in the targeted environments. It's essential to understand that specific compiler optimizations may bypass `memset()` and in such cases, implementing what's required such as using explicit or secure functions based on the platform is recommended.
