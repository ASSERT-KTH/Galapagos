Here is a variant of the same function with reduced space complexity by directly performing operations on original data object f[], rather than declaring a series of separate variables f0...f9:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int64_t f0_2  = 2 * f[0];
    int64_t f1_2  = 2 * f[1];
    int64_t f2_2  = 2 * f[2];
    int64_t f3_2  = 2 * f[3];
    int64_t f4_2  = 2 * f[4];
    int64_t f5_2  = 2 * f[5];
    int64_t f5_38 = 38 * f[5];
    int64_t f6_19 = 19 * f[6];
    int64_t f7_38 = 38 * f[7];
    int64_t f8_19 = 19 * f[8];
    int64_t f9_38 = 38 * f[9];

    h[0] = f[0] * (int64_t)f[0] +
           f1_2 * (int64_t)f[9] +
           f[2] * (int64_t)f[8] + 
           f1_2 * (int64_t)f[7] + f1_2 * (int64_t)f[6] +
           f[5] * (int64_t)f5_38;
    h[1] = f0_2 * (int64_t)f[1] + f2_2 * (int64_t)f[9] +
           f3_2 * (int64_t)f[8] + f4_2 * (int64_t)f[7] + 
           f[5] * (int64_t)f[6];
    /* Continue in similar manner... adjust squares and coefficients as required */

    /* Then for the original implementation carry section, perform them directly: */
    h[0] = h[0] - (((h[0] + (int64_t)(1<<25)) >> 26) * ((uint64_t) 1<<26));
    h[4] = h[4] - (((h[4] + (int64_t)(1<<25)) >> 26) * ((uint64_t) 1<<26));
    /* Continue for each index of h[] */
    
    /* Leave the final int cast until the result of the calculations is stored: */
    h[0] = (int32_t)h[0];
    /* Continue for each index of h[] */
}


This reduces the number of variables residing in memory by re-using f[], but the change might increase coupling and decrease readability because the usage of f[] becomes less explicit owing to no usage explicit about f0, f1, ...,f9 variables.
