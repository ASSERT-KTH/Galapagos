Here is a program variant that still fulfills the described task while changing the syntax and approach. This code leverages standard memset method which is part of C library <string.h>:


#include <string.h>

void sodium_memzero(void * const pnt, const size_t len) {
    /* protecting against compiler optimizations */
    volatile unsigned char *volatile char_pointer = 
        (volatile unsigned char *volatile) pnt;
    memset(char_pointer, 0, len);
}

The original code offers different conditional compiling options for implementing the behavior. This does not incorporate such design which makes it appear less complex, making the behavior substitution less explicit. This variant does not make use of numerous memory cleaning algorithms, but only uses memset and, following the footstep of the last approach suggested in the initial code, it adopts a volatile keyword to make an attempt in serving as an 'optimization barrier'.
