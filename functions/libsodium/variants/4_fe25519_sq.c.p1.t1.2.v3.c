The given C code for the `fe25519_sq` function is heavily optimized and well-structured; changing its behavior but maintaining its functionality is challenging and due to nature of the algorithm it is not very good candiate to play with different strategies. However, it can be refactorized to enhance readability but performing the same mathematical calculations, with no expected change in runtime behavior:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int32_t fi[10], fi_2[10], fi_38[8];
    int64_t ffi[10][10], hi[10], carry[10];
 
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        fi[i] = f[i];
        if (i != 4 && i != 9)
            fi_2[i] = f[i] * 2;
    }
    
    for (int i = 4; i < 9; i++)
        fi_38[i] = (i % 2) ? 19 * fi[i + 1] : 38 * fi[i + 1];

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
            ffi[i][j] = (int64_t)fi[i] * ((j == 6 || j == 9 || (j >= i && j != 4 && j != 9))? fi[j] : fi_2[j]);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++)
        hi[i] = ffi[i][i] + ffi[i+1][9-i] * ((i <= 4)? 38:19) + (i<8 ? ffi[i+2][(8-i)%2?0:4] * ((8-i)%2?19:38) + ffi[i+3][(7-i)%2?0:4] * ((7-i)%2?19:38):0);
    
    hi[9] = ffi[4][5] + ffi[5][5] * 38;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        carry[(i == 9) ? 0: (i+1)] = (hi[i] + (int64_t)(1L << ((i==0 || i==2 || i==4 || i==6 || i==8)? 25:24))) >> ((i==1 || i==3 || i==5 || i==7)? 25:26);
        hi[i] -= carry[(i == 9) ? 0: (i+1)] * ((uint64_t) 1L << ((i==1 || i==3 || i==5 || i==7)? 25:26));
    }
    
    hi[0] += carry[0] * 19;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        h[i] = (int32_t)hi[i];
}

Please note - This transformed code is clear to understand, but may not be as efficient as the original code, since it introduces more array indexing and looping computations.
While it should appear functionally equivalent to the original code for the `fe25519_sq` function, it should still be tested thoroughly with a variety of inputs to ensure correctness before being used in a production environment.
