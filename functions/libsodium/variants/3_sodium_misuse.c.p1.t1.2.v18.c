A potential variant of the original function is the follow:


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void) = _misuse_handler;
    
    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0 && handler != NULL) {
        handler();
    }
    else {
        abort();
    }
}


In the variant, the assignment was pulled up, mergeing the nested if block into single if condition by merging both condition thus reducing the levels of branches. However this variant maintains the original functioning of the `sodium_misuse()` method.
