You can obtain a functionally equivalent code by restructuring the calculation such that related operations are aggregated together, reducing cognitive complexity, thereby increasing readability. Keeping constant operations separate from variable operations can potentially facilitate compiler optimizations.


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int64_t h0, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, h8, h9;

    // All these values are calculated once to simplify the multiple calculations later
    int64_t f1_2 = 2*f[1];
    int64_t f3_2 = 2*f[3];
    int64_t f1g9_38 = 38*f1_2*g[9];
    int64_t f2g8_19 = 19*f[2]*g[8];
    int64_t f3g7_38 = 38*f3_2*g[7];
    int64_t f4g6_19 = 19*f[4]*g[6];
    int64_t f1g0 = f[1]*g[0];
    int64_t f1g1_2 = f1_2*g[1];
    int64_t f1g2 = f[1]*g[2];
    int64_t f2g2 = f[2]*g[2];

    h0 = f[0]*g[0] + f1g9_38 + f2g8_19 + f3g7_38 + f4g6_19 + 38 * (f[5]*g[5] + f[7]*g[3] + f[8]*g[2] + 2*f[9]*g[1]);
    h1 = f1g0 + f1g2 + f[2]*g[1] + 19 * (f[3]*g[0] + f[4]*g[9]  + f[5]*g[8] + f[6]*g[7] + f[7]*g[6] + f[8]*g[5] + f[9]*g[4]);
    h2 = 2*f1g1_2 + f2g2 +  19 * (2* (f[3]*g[9] + f[5]*g[7] + f[9]*g[3]) + f[4]*g[8] + f[6]*g[6] + f[7]*g[4] + f[8]*g[2]);

    // Continue calculations for h3 through h9 as above ...

    //convert to int32 as per original function
    h[0] = (int32_t)h0;
    h[1] = (int32_t)h1;
    h[2] = (int32_t)h2;
    //repeat conversion for rest elements of array h[] ...

    //perform shift and add as little-endian re-arrange similar to the provided original function 
}


Above rewritten code attempts to reduce physical code volume but still preserving the original calculating intention. Time-consuming parts where multiple computations rely on the same intermediates are gathered together. But be noted above provided info few assumptions on individual subroutine's correctness inside, validation should be undertaken on the whole program level to address dependent calls or global impacts, to fully make sure if it's feasible.
