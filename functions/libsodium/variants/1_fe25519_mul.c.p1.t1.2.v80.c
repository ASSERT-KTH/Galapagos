The variant of the implementation could be as mentioned below:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g) {
    int64_t h_arr[10] = {0};
    
    size_t dim_size = 10;
    for(size_t i = 0; i < dim_size; i++) {
        for(size_t j = 0; j < dim_size - i; j++) {

            int64_t ij_mul = f[i] * (int64_t) g[j];
            if(i != 0 && j != 0 && i != j) {
                ij_mul *= 2;
            }
            if(j == dim_size - i - 1) {
                ij_mul *= 38;
            }
            h_arr[(i + j) % dim_size] += ij_mul;            
        }        
    }

    for(size_t i = 0; i < dim_size; i++) {
        int64_t carry = (h_arr[i] + (int64_t)(1L << (2*dim_size - 2*(i % 2)))) >> (2*dim_size - 1*(i % 2 + 1));
        size_t next_index = (i == dim_size - 1 ) ? 0 : i+1;
        h_arr[next_index] += (next_index % 2 == 1) ? carry * 19 : carry;
        h_arr[i] -= carry << (2*dim_size - 1*(i % 2 + 1));
        h[i] = (int32_t) h_arr[i];
    }
}


Here fe25519 is assumed to be a 1-D integer array holding the coefficients of the equation. This version of the function creates an integer array, `h_arr`, to hold the 10 distinct sum terms multiplied and then paired. By looping over the dimensions, a series of multiplication and culminative products become 'group operation'. Finally, carry-propagated normalization is implemented at the end. However, since this 'carrying procedure' is wrapped in a for-loop and checks the index to help decide whether to shift by 25 (for even indices) or 26 (for odd ones) and whether or not to multiply by 19, it only has to run 10 times--one for each coefficient-- which effectively skips the straightforward normalization after individual multiplication in the original solution. 

This solution simplifies the original. Nonetheless, its overall complexity is still O(n^2), given n as the number of array terms with integer coefficients.
