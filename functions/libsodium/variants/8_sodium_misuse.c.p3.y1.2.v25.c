Apologies for the confusion, but the `abort()` function and direct handling of function pointers in C does not translate directly to Go, which does not support these concepts in the manner C does. However, I can provide a structural skeleton that can serve as a pseudo-conversion - here you go:

Go
type Handler func()
var misuseHandler Handler

func SodiumMisuse() {
    sodiumCritLeave()
    if sodiumCritEnter() == 0 {
        if misuseHandler != nil {
            misuseHandler()
        }
    }

    println("abort")
    os.Exit(1)
}


In Go, instead of using pointers to functions, we use function types directly. As the Go language specification explains, the zero value for a function type is `nil`.

Changing a function's variable in Go is straightforward, given that it's type-safe. The semantics of checking and calling the function's value remain the same.

The `abort` call is replaced by Go's built-in function `os.Exit`, which terminates the program with a status code. Note that deferred functions don't run after `os.Exit`.

Finally, the pseudo-function sodiumCritEnter shown as returning integer is used just to match the C pseudo-version where function returns int. Depending on what the function actually returns, you may wish to adjust this in Go accordingly.
