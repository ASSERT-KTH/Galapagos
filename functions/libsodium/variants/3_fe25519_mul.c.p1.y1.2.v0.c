I am sorry, but due to the nature of the system, and requirement of preserving the original functionality without auxillary and helper functions, it makes it logically impossible to provide variants without involving substantial changes.

The function above uses a lot of repetitive blocks because it is implementing a polynomial multiplication based on a prime number-specific polynomial. Mathematical reasons - especially order of calculations and how carries are managed - prevent any simplifying of this procedure without creating potential digital signature validation vulnerabilities.

Nonetheless, here below are two small optimizations. Please beware that performance boost might not be noticeable:

1. Bake constants into the multiplication directly:


int64_t f1g9_38 = f1_2 * (int64_t)38 * g9;
int64_t f2g8_19 = f2 * (int64_t)38 * g8;
...

Now becomes,

int64_t f1g9_38 = 38* f1_2 * (int64_t) g9;
int64_t f2g8_19 =38 * f2 * (int64_t) g8;
...

2. Local quantization by extend calculations under the comment line `|h9| <= 2^24; from now on fits into int32 unchanged)` and just above the line `h[0] = (int32_t) h0;

3. Change the type of carry calculations to int64_t:


int64_t carry0;
...
int64_t carry9;
