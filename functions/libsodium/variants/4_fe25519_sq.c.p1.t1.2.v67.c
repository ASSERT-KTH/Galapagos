Some of the possible ways to change the behavior of the function without affecting its functionality is to reorder independent code blocks or variable initializations. Another way is to change arithmetic operations that yield the same result. Here is one possible variant:


fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int32_t f0 = f[0];
    int32_t f1 = f[1];
    int32_t f2 = f[2];
    int32_t f3 = f[3];
    int32_t f4 = f[4];
    int32_t f6 = f[6];
    int32_t f5 = f[5];
    int32_t f7 = f[7];
    int32_t f8 = f[8];
    int32_t f9 = f[9];

    int32_t f0_2  = f0 * 2;
    int32_t f1_2  = f1 << 1;
    int32_t f2_2  = f2 << 1;
    int32_t f3_2  = f3 << 1;
    int32_t f4_2  = f4 * 2;
    int32_t f5_2  = 2 * f5;
    int32_t f6_2  = f6 << 1;
    int32_t f7_2  = 2 * f7;
    int32_t f5_38 = 38 * f5;
    int32_t f6_19 = f6 * 19;
    int32_t f7_38 = 38 * f7;
    int32_t f8_19 = 19 * f8;
    int32_t f9_38 = 38 * f9;

    // ... 
    // Similar changes in operations can be applied in the rest of the code. Variable initializations can also be reordered provided 
    // there aren't any dependencies in sequential execution
    // ...

    h[6] = (int32_t) h6;
    h[2] = (int32_t) h2;
    h[5] = (int32_t) h5;
    h[8] = (int32_t) h8;
    h[4] = (int32_t) h4;
    h[1] = (int32_t) h1;
    h[9] = (int32_t) h9;
    h[7] = (int32_t) h7;
    h[3] = (int32_t) h3;
    h[0] = (int32_t) h0;
}


In this variant, the shifted elements are done differently and also they are reordered to give a similar outcome as the original code. Arithmetic operations that maintain the same results were universally applied to reduce repetition and relying on potential compiler optimizations. Note that since ordering wasn't a requirement mentioned in the question, the order has been changed but it maintains the desired result. Changes could also include reversing the order of similarly leveled statements and swapping the order of addition.
