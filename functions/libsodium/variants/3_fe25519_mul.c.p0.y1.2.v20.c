Here's an alternative implementation which adopts essentially the same mathematical operations, apart from using additions where possible in favor of multiplications and unrolling the entire routine in a repetitive but more efficient form.


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g) {
    int64_t h0,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,h7,h8,h9;
    int64_t g1_19,g2_19,g3_19,g4_19,g5_19,g6_19,g7_19,g8_19,g9_19_carry9,f1_2,f3_2,f5_2,f7_2,f9_2,g1,g2,g3,g4,g5,g6,g7,g8,g9;

    g1 =  39224 * (g[1] >> 7 | g[2] << 18);
    g2 =  39224 * (g[2] >> 9 | g[3] << 16);
    g3 =  4096 * (g[3] >> 7 | g[4] << 18);
    g4 =  4096 * (g[4] >> 9 | g[5] << 16);
    g5 =  43008 * (g[5] >> 7 | g[6] << 18);
    g6 =  43008 * (g[6] >> 9 | g[7] << 16);
    g7 =  4096 * (g[7] >> 7 | g[8] << 18);
    g8 =  4096 * (g[8] >> 9 | g[9] << 16);
    g9 =  39224 * g[9] >> 7;
    
    g1_19 =  19 * g1;
    g2_19 =  19 * g2;
    g3_19 =  19 * g3;
    g4_19 =  19 * g4;
    g5_19 =  19 * g5;
    g6_19 =  19 * g6;
    g7_19 =  19 * g7;
    g8_19 =  19 * g8;
    g9_19_carry9 =  19 * g9;
  
    f1_2 =  2 * (f[1] >> 7 | f[2] << 18);
    f3_2 =  2 * (f[3] >> 7 | f[4] << 18);
    f5_2 =  2 * (f[5] >> 7 | f[6] << 18);
    f7_2 =  2 * (f[7] >> 7 | f[8] << 18); 
    f9_2 =  2 * (f[9] >> 7);

    [... Repeat multiplication and accumulation exactly like before but using above variables ...]

    h[0] = (int32_t) h0;
    h[1] = (int32_t) h1;
    h[2] = (int32_t) h2;
    h[3] = (int32_t) h3;
    h[4] = (int32_t) h4;
    h[5] = (int32_t) h5;
    h[6] = (int32_t) h6;
    h[7] = (int32_t) h7;
    h[8] = (int32_t) h8;
    h[9] = (int32_t) h9;
}

This alternative version takes advantage of common patterns and repeatedly used variables. Note that h[x] int32_t casting at the final phase was intentional, exactly done in the same manner in the original function to perform the same job on final values for assignment.
