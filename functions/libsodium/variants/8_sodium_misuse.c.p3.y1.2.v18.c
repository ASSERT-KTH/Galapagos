In Go, there's no direct equivalent to C's function pointers. But you can achieve similar results using interface. However, it's hard to provide equivalents for "sodium_crit_enter", "sodium_crit_leave", and "abort" because these are specific methods from some sorts of C library called `libsodium` and Go doesn't have direct equivalents for such functionalities. However, I'll provide a skeleton using Go's panic (similar to abort()), interface, and keeping the logic flow similar as possible,

go
type MisuseHandler interface {
    Handle()
}

var misuseHandler MisuseHandler

func SodiumMisuse() {
    defer func() {
        recover() // equivalent to sodium_crit_leave
    }()

    err := sodiumCritEnter() // not a direct equivalent,equivalent of sodium_crit_enter
    if err != nil {
        if misuseHandler != nil {
            misuseHandler.Handle()
        }
    }

    panic("") // equivalent to abort
}

func sodiumCritEnter() error {
   // It's not clearly provided what sodium_crit_enter does in the problem
   // Fill this function as your requirement.
   return nil
}
