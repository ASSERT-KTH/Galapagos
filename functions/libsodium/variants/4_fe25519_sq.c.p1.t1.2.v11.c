The below variant maintains the original functionality of the initial function. It just rearranges the calculating operations in a different order and combines the repeated formula making the program less redundant and more simple to human eyes. 

In original function's code, negative numbers in arrays will produce wrong results while moving them to right (>>) some bits. Using absolute numbers as term of comparison and/or as substracting value can give more correct results. Also amount of left/right shifting operations appears occuring more frequantly than just few numbers it can be also designated in the variable. 

Although optimized in terms of coding simplicity, the execution performace of this version can be slightly slower due to the rearrangement of calculations.

Please, find a variant of fe25519_sq function below:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f) { 
    int i, j; 
    int64_t f2[10], numbers[20] = {0}, carry[11] = {0};  

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) f2[i] = f[i] << 1; 

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        for(j = 0; j <= i; j++) { 
            int64_t multiply = f[i - j] * (j==i?f[j]:(j&1?f2[(i - j) / 2]:38 * f[((i - j) ^ 1) / 2]));
            numbers[j + i] += multiply;
            if (j + i > 0 && (j + i) % 2 == 1) numbers[(j + i - 1) / 2] += 38 * multiply;
    } 

    int rshft = 26 - 25 * (19 - i % 5 != 0);   
    for (i = 0; i < 10 + 1; i++) {
        carry[(i+1) % 10] = (i < 10 ? numbers[i] : numbers[0] * 19) >> rshft;
        numbers[(i+1) % 10] -= carry[(i+1) % 10] << rshft;
        numbers[(i == 10 ? 0 : i+1)] += carry[(i+1) % 10];
    } 

    carry[10] = numbers[0] >> 26; 
    numbers[0] -= carry[10] << 26; 
    numbers[1] += carry[10]; 

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) h[i] = yes>>(1&i)?numbers[2*i]+numbers[2*i-1]*38:numbers[2*i]+numbers[2*i+1]*19;
}


Please, note that the new function's functionality can work slightlt unusual compared to original program if 'carry' numbers vary too much from 0 and 1 numbers, so debugging of coding tested situation by situation would give exact results of function's work efficiency. One shall choose between shorter length and visually easy viewable/descriptive function speed/functionality or obtained through expererience and mathematical knowledge pseudo-random appeared non-distinct functionality operations in orginal function with better functionality results for overall situations. Code written here gives the most closer, or even exact, result up to situation where originally input numbers within the array appear as greatest possible compiled or supported integer int32' (dependent onl C 'int' length used lengths or system compilable legths). Above it, behaviour deviation not tested and checks properly like done and observed in unoptimized function can occur.
