Sure, the core functionality of the function can be maintained with a slight variant as follows:


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    if (sodium_crit_leave() >= 0) { // Assuming sodium_crit_leave returns a non-negative integer on success
        if (sodium_crit_enter() != 0) {
            return;
        }
        handler = _mishandler; 
        if (handler) {
            (*handler)();  // making invoke explicit
        }
    }

/* LCOV_EXCL_START */
    abort();
}

In this version the abort call is still being made in case of failure (matching original expected behaviour if a safe state cannot be achieved), but additionally I’ve inverted the logic around the critical section entering to provide a return if entering the critical section isn’t feasible, rather than the original simply cascading down into its potential abort scenario. This variant allows intermediate handling or intervention from the caller. It also checks whether `sodium_crit_leave` layer succeeded without ignoring its return value. The assignment to `handler` variant and explicit invoke can also potentially improve readability.
