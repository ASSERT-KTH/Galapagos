Here is a variant of the function's reference implementation:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g) 
{
    int i, j;
    int64_t tmp[19] = {0};
    
    for(i=0;i<10;i++)
    {
        for(j=0;j<10;j++)
        {
            if((i+j)%2 == 0) {
                tmp[(i+j)/2] += (f[i] * (int64_t)g[j]) ;
            } else {
                tmp[(i+j)/2] += 19 * ((i&1?f[i]<<1:f[i]) * (int64_t)(j&1?g[j]<<1:g[j])) ;
            }
        }
    }

    for(i=0;i<9;++i)
    {
         /* Implicit: (1 u << 26) == ((1LL << 52) mod u) */
        tmp[i+1] += ( tmp[i] >> 26 );
        tmp[i] &= 0x3ffffff;
    }

    {
         int64_t t = tmp[9] >> 25;
         tmp[0]+= 19*t;
         tmp[9]&= 0x1ffffff;
    }

    for(i=0; i<10; ++i) {
        h[i] = tmp[i];
    }
}


Even though the two pieces of code have different means of achieving it, both versions have corresponding terms in the computation to ensure the same results. However, the above version of the code uses looping constructs to significantly reduce code size.
Performance is less clear and would be subject to how well the compiler is able to optimize the end compiled code.
