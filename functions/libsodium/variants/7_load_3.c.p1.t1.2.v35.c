The provided code indicates the implementation of a function in the C programming language. The function takes an argument of type pointer to const unsigned char, then reads the data the points lead to and returns the combined result of the first three points, types cast to uint64_t. 

The behavior of THIS function may be changed, without altering its original functionality, by reading the memory locations in reverse order. Below is a variant of the function.


load_3(const unsigned char *in) 
{
    uint64_t result = 0;

    result = (uint64_t)in[2] << 16;
    result |= ((uint64_t) in[1]) << 8;
    result |= ((uint64_t) in[0]);
    
    return result;
}

This variant does a similar work as load_3() above but differs in sequence; how it reads the three locations pointed to by the pointer - 'in'. It would yield the same return, but works different way. This changes behaviour yet as stated, it doesn't necessarily alter functionality. However, note this change would significantly have effect depending on what types and of what meaningful use this code stood to be utilized, part of broader program.
