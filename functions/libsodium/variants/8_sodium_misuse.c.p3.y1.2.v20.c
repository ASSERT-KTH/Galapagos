Go does not support function pointers in the same way as C and while we can achieve similar functionality with interfaces and methods in Go, we cannot actually replicate the specific functionality of sodium_crit_enter(), sodium_crit_leave() and abort() due to Go's runtime and the absence of these functions in Go libraries. 

However, we can structure a similar function using Go's code structure and report functions panics (Go's equivalent for C's sudden terminating case that abolish should handle) like below, there is no direct equivalent function in Go like 'abort()':     

go
func SodiumMisuse() {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            if misuseHandler != nil {
                misuseHandler.handle()
            }
        }
        panic("Abort!")
    }()

    // sodiumCritLeave() - needs an equivalent in Go which doesn't exist
    // if sodiumCritEnter() == 0: - needs an equivalent in Go which doesn't exist
    if SodiumCritEnter() == 0 {
        if misuseHandler != nil {
            misuseHandler.handle()
        }
    }

    panic("Abort!")
}
    
type MisuseHandler struct {}

func (m *MisuseHandler) handle() {
    // specific error handling
} 
    
 
 
 Above we consider another struct named ‘MisuseHandler’ which would takeover functions role in golang that is implemented in C. Misuse handler is considered as a global variable for the shake of this code comparison.
