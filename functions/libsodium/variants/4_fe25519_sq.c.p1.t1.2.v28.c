Sure, there are various ways to maintain a function's functionality while altering its behavior including minor optimizations for efficiency. For example, we might remove the additional variable declarations and perform most calculations directly. Please consider following variant:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int32_t f0_2  = 2 * f[0];
    int32_t f1_2  = 2 * f[1];
    int32_t f2_2  = 2 * f[2];
    int64_t f0f0  = f[0] * (int64_t)f[0];
    int64_t f1f1_2  = f1_2 * (int64_t)f[1];

    int64_t h0 = f0f0 + f1_2 * (int64_t) (38 * f[9]) + f2_2 * (int64_t) (19 * f[8]) + f1_2 * (int64_t) (38 * f[7]) + f0_2 * (int64_t) (38 * f[6]) + f[5] * (int64_t) (38 * f[5]);
    int64_t h1 = f0f1_2  + f2_2 * (int64_t) (38 * f[9]) + f1_2 * (int64_t) (38 * f[8]) + f0_2 * (int64_t) (38 * f[7]) + f1_2 * (int64_t) (38 * f[6]);
    int64_t h2 = f0f2_2 + f1f1_2 + f1_2 * (int64_t) (38 * f[9]) + f0_2 * (int64_t) (38 * f[8]) + f2_2 * (int64_t) (38 * f[7]) + f[2] * (int64_t) (38 * f[6]);
    // similar assignments for h3 to h9

    int64_t carry0 = (h0 + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
    h[1] = (int32_t) (h[1] + carry0);
    h[0] = (int32_t) (h0 - carry0 * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26));
    // similar calculations for remaining h[2] to h[9]
}

 
In this variant, we calculated several products directly rather than precalculate as a separate step, helping to optimize memory use. Comments replace right truncation so it may be less readable to some, but functionality should match the original as long `f` values in range to abstain from int overflow during multiply.
Note: Because of the whole numbers operation, mathematics are behaviorally same but inflections may differ. You should run exhaustive functional tests if optimal precision and numeric stability are critical.
