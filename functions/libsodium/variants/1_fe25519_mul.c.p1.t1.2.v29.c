Although the given C function can be optimized for speed and readability using advanced techniques like leveraging hardware-specific instructions for multiply and accumulate, its reference implementation seems like using simple widely supported C instructions, maximizing function compatibility.

However, an alternative code variant can reduce the amount of code through simple refactoring while achieving the same functionality:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int32_t multiply_factor[2] = {2, 19};
    int64_t temp[10][10] = {0};
    
    for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
        for (int j=0; j<10; j++) {
            int32_t factor = ((j&1) == (i&1)) ? multiply_factor[0] : multiply_factor[1];
            int64_t a      = i < j || (j&1) ? f[i] : factor*f[i];
            int64_t b      = i > j || (i&1) ? g[j] : factor*g[j];
            
            temp[(i+j)%10][(i+j)/10] += a*b;   
        }
    }

    temp[0][1] += 19*temp[9][0];
    for(int i=0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        int index = i == 0 ? 9 : i - 1;
        temp[i][1]  += temp[index][0] / ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);
        
        h[i]   = ((int64_t) (temp[i][0] % ((uint64_t) 1L << 26)));
    }
}


The outer-outer loop constructs all the products i*j and sum them in their required positions, taking care of the multiply factors and assign it accordingly. This results significant suppressing to the heavy complex expressing and keep readability to a higher extend. The end of the function normalizes the results and store them in the array referenced by `h`. Note that 'h' array is an output of the function.
