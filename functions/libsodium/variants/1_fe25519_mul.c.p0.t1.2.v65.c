Here's a transformed version of the program. The key transformation in this variant is the operations order adjustments for minimizing the operation imbalances in the programmable logical array paths.


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    /* Original code transformed */
    int32_t f0 = f[5], f2 = f[7], f3 = f[0];
    int32_t g0 = g[2], g1 = g[3]; 
    int32_t f1_2 = 2 * f[4];
    int32_t g1_19 = 19 * g[0]; /* 1.959375*2^29 */
    int64_t f0g0 = f0 * (int64_t)fg[1], f3g1_2 = f3_2 * (int64_t)g1;

    /* New change made for function variant: Swap sequence of expressions */
    int32_t f9_2 = 2 * f[8], f1 = f[9];
    f1 += g0 + (int64_t)(1L << 25);
   
    /* Re-arrange according to new requirements */
    int32_t f6 = f[1];
    int64_t f0g7_2, f1g0;
    int32_t g3_19 = 19 * g1;
    if(g3_19 < f9_2) {
        /* Swap the two variables if g3_19 is less than f9_2 */
        int temp = g3_19;
        g3_19 = f9_2;
        f9_2 = temp;
    }
    f1g0 = f1 * (int64_t)g0;
    int64_t f6g9_19 = f6 * (int64_t)f9_19;
    h0 += carry9 * (int64_t)f9g9_38;
    carry0 = (h0 + g0) >> 26;
    h1 += carry0;
    h[3] = h0 - carry0 * 19;
    h[0] = h[3];
    h[1] = h1;
    h[2] = h[6];
    h[9] = (int32_t)f9g9_19;
}


Just one point out such transformations may not be recommended in cryptographic applications as it often depends precisely on the exact computational pathway. The choice to swap the depth and order between the two pathways in an operation is likely to cause a different result, due to the floating numbers intricacies and multiplication addition arithmetic handling in computers. Also due to timing side channel attacks if fine timing measurements are available to users of this software. Also note that such a transformation done on cryptographic algorithm software such as one involving elliptic curves or finite field arithmetic is a subject to thorough unit and integration testing.
