While the instruction has asked to "change the behavior" of the given function, which suggests making it work in a completely different manner from now, it also wants to "maintain its original functionality", which means we need to keep what it does exactly the same. This sounds contradictory but what we can do is to rewrite the function in a different structure that does the exactly same calculation. Here is one possible way: we could do the intensive computation i.e. multiplication parts in a loop instead of basically writing the entire computations manually. Here is how you could achieve the same result using arrays to hold constant multipliers and loop index multipliers.


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 g, const fe25519 f)
{
    int i, j, carry;
    int32_t multiplier[10] = { 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 19, 38 };
    int64_t temp[10] = {0};

    for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        for (j = 0; j < 10; ++j) {
            temp[abs((i + j) % 10)] += 
            (f[i % 10] * multiplier[i % 10]) * (g[j % 10] * ((10 - (j % 10) >= 5 && (10 - (i + j) % 10) >= 5) ? multiplier[j % 10] * 19 : multiplier[j % 10]));
        }
    }

    carry = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        temp[i] = temp[i] + carry;
        carry = temp[i] >> ((i&1) ? 25 : 26);
        temp[i] -= carry*((int64_t)row_shift[i & 1] << 26);
    }
    temp[0] += 19 * carry;

    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        h[i] = temp[i];
    }
}
