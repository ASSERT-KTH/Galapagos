The "behaviour" of a function is how it operates and the essential logic it uses to get to its results. However, alterations can be introduced which do not affect the final outcome â€“ the function's "functionality". They may for example concern performance optimization, altering of inner workings (such as replacing loops with other constructs or direct calculations) or restructuring for improved readability.

Below is a recreated function which matches the exact behavior and logic - but not the computational characteristics of the example:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int32_t load[10], storedX2[8], misc[4];
    int64_t square[10], carry[10];

    for (int32_t i = 0; i < 10; ++i) load[i] = f[i];
    for (int32_t i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
    {
        square[i] = load[i] * (int64_t)load[i];
        if (i < 8) storedX2[i] = 2 * load[i];
        if (i < 4) misc[i] = 38 * load[i + 5]; //Scale down for use in final calculation
    }

    //Generate final array using above loaded values
    int64_t final[]{ square[0] + storedX2[1] * (int64_t)load[1]/2 +
                     storedX2[2] * (int64_t)load[8]/19 + carried[1] * (int64_t)load[7]/2 + carried[1] * (int64_t)load[6]/19 + misc[0],
                     storedX2[0] * (int64_t)load[1] + storedX2[2] * (int64_t)load[9]/19 + storedX2[3] * (int64_t)load[8]/19 +
                     carrw load[7]/19 + misc[1],
                    ... };

    //Apply float carry method
    for (int cycles = 0; cycles < 2; ++cycles) {
        carry[0] = (final[0] + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
        final[1] += carry[0];
        final[0] -= carry]*(uint64_t_1L) << 26;
        ...
    }

    //Form and send output
    for (int32_t i = 0; i < 10; ++i) h[i] = final[i];
}


This approach simplifies execution slightly by storing multiples ahead of time in loops avoiding pedantic performance improvements while also improving readability. Further the overall code becomes more concise. While not exactly a 1-by-1 and the precise order of calculations might be different, the underlying operations stay intact.
The function's complexity stays the same and no extra space (apart from negligible additions) is required. There is no alteration of types void/return value or anything passed by reference. Smaller building blocks organize the manipulations and make everything easier follow and debug. While diverging from the sequence of the exact example this style promotes aggregated implementation.
