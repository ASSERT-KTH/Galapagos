Unfortunately, a direct conversion of the function signature from C to Go isn't possible. However, the usual Go idiomatic way of working with bytes and buffers is to return the result. Here is a possible equivalent in Go, assuming that the "randombytes_init_if_needed()" and "implementation.buf" functions from C can be similarly reflected in the inbuilt Go's cryptographic/rand package functions `rand.Read()`.

Also in Go, there is no need to particularly check if size of the buffer is greater than zero (size > 0), if the size is indeed zero, the `rand.Read()` function will autoamtically handle it.

Here is the equivalent Go function:
go
package main
  
import (
  crand "crypto/rand"
  "io"
  "fmt"
)


func randomBytesBuf(size int) (byteBuffer []byte, err error) {
    byteBuffer = make([]byte, size)
    _, err = io.ReadFull(crand.Reader, byteBuffer)
    
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Error! Problem generating random bytes: %w", err)
    }

    return byteBuffer, err
}

The above Go function helps to serve the same purpose as the given C function. With the `size` passed in as argument, generates a slice of bytes of specified size with random bytes then returns it.

Note of caution that uninitialized byte slices starts with zero value (not random), if this function fail to read from rand.Reader, the error alone would be returned and handling would be depending from where function was called. Very important to always check for errors when calling this function.
