Even though rewriting whole code might change a functionality that's instructed not to change, we can try to modify code in efficient way not hurting any functionality at all and making code clearer as well. A modifiable multiforme of the above C code function is provided given below.

N.B.:- Geeks vary by time, countries and versions. 'ergomatic inline cout, ## pragmas/ifdef might not work in older c and c++11 Note That ..., they work considering mainly inline for c++14 or 17 above++ or others but not compliant with littleer ones on prevailing idea. But with greater or =c++11 use -E commandline FLag to find out existence of them. This is done is understand you same transformation for older of even older such ideas.
