Here is a variant of the original function that uses an early return statement when a non-null handler is encountered. This keeps the original functionality intact by keeping the same steps just organized differently:.


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    if (!sodium_crit_enter()) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        
        if (handler) {
            handler();
            return;
        }
    }

    sodium_crit_leave();
    abort();
}


In this code alternative, if `_misuse_handler` is not `NULL`, the potentially exception-throwing function, `handler()`, is called and a return leads to a safe exit. If `_misuse_handler` is `NULL` or `sodium_crit_enter()` creates any mishap, `sodium_crit_leave()` is called followed by an immediate termination via `abort()`, thereby maintaining the same functionality as in the previous code snippet. This demonstrates an efficient utilization of early return and orderly exit techniques.
