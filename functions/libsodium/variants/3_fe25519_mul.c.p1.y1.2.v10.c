Here are a couple of ways you could implement the original function using different code transformations that preserve its original functionality:

First Transformation:

fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int32_t vecf[10];
    int32_t vecg[10];

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        vecf[i] = f[i];
        vecg[i] = g[i];
    }

    int32_t g1_19, f1_2;
    int64_t f0g0, f1g1_2, h0, carry0, carry1;

    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
    {
        g1_19 = 19 * vecg[j];
        f1_2 = 2 * vecf[j];
        f0g0 = vecf[0] * (int64_t) vecg[0];
        f1g1_2 = f1_2 * (int64_t) vecg[1];

        h0 = f0g0 + f1g1_2;

        carry0 = (h0 + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
        vecf[1] += carry0;
        h0 -= carry0 * ((uint64_t)1L << 26);
        carry1 = (vecf[1] + (int64_t)(1L << 24)) >> 25;
        h0 += carry1 * 19;
        vecf[1] -= carry1 * ((uint64_t)1L << 25);
        carry0 = (h0 + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
        vecf[1] += carry0;
        h0 -= carry0 * ((uint64_t)1L << 26);

        h[j] = (int32_t)h0;
    }
}

In this case, we are looping through each of the elements instead of explicitly writing them out. Note that this wouldn't work if the operations for each element were not similar or dependent on iteration index.

Second Transformation:


fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g) 
{
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){ 
        int32_t x = f[i];
        int32_t y = g[i]; 
        int32_t y1_19 = 19 * y; 
        int32_t x1_2 = 2 * x; 

        // compute respective vlues same as original
    
        int64_t x0y0 = x * (int64_t) y;
        int64_t x1y1_2 = x1_2 * (int64_t) y; 

        int64_t tempH = ...  // computation similar to original

        int64_t carry = ...  // compute carry similar to original

        h[i] = tempH;
    }
}


In this method, operations are transformed into a loop which concurrently assigns the needed variables from "f" and "g" arrays and similar computations and carried out. Just like previous case this wouldn't work if the operations vary a lot for different indexes.  

Both of these transformations sacrifice some optimization which the original function might have had (like performing different operations in parallel for different "f" and "g" ), in the interest of compactness and simplicity of the code.
