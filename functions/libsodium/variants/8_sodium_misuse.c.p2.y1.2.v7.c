First, let's understand the function. It's originally designed to call a handler if it is assigned and, in any case, abort the program execution brutally.

It first exits a critical section ("sodium_crit_leave"), then tries to enter a critical section ("sodium_crit_enter").

Note: In multi-threaded programs, critical sections are sections where synchronous accesses to shared variables are required to prevent concurrency issues. "sodium_crit_leave" & "sodium_crit_enter" safeguard those sections to enable the program to meet its requirement - however it's done.

Under the assumption that the "handler" function always finish successfully and not interrupt the program flow (as the original abort run anyway), and considering "entering and leaving critical section" operations don't change the state, I suggest a program variant for function "sodium_misuse(void)" like this:

Variant program:

sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    int crit_result;
    
    crit_result = sodium_crit_enter();
              
    if (!crit_result) {
        sodium_crit_leave();
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
        }
        abort();
    }
    
}

I rolled the fast exit abort into the "enter crit is OK" main branch (same behavior), and release resources our fictitious handler may use inside the `handler()` call as it seems right to let the used resources available ASAP. The semantic is the same - where obvious the handler has needed resources available in both versions.
