The main equivalencies to keep from the original C code to the Go implementation are _misuse_handler(target function), sodium_crit_enter equivalent of Go's entering a piece of code critical section, sodium_crit_leave equivalent of leaving critical section("Sync/Mutex") and abort, Go equivalent("os.Exit"). However, unlike C, Go doesn't support functions as a type, it gets transformed into an interface. Following the actual semantically equivalent conversion:

go
import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"sync"
)

var (
	_misuse_handler func()
	lock            sync.Mutex
)

/*	sodium_crit_enter()	is translated into	lock.Lock()	*/
/*	sodium_crit_leave()	is translated into lock.Unlock()	*/
/*	handler()		is lifted into	_misuse_handler()	*/
/*	abort()			is lifted	up to	os.Exit()	*/

//	A simple mock of _misuse_handler (placeholder of a function void handler(void))
func mock_handler() {
	fmt.Println("Handler invoked!")
}

func main() {
	_misuse_handler = mock_handler  // Mock assignment, could be replaced with any relevant func

	SodiumMisuse()
}

func SodiumMisuse() {
	lock.Unlock()
	lock.Lock()
	if _misuse_handler != nil {
		_misuse_handler()
	}
	os.Exit(1)
}

Moreover, this implementation gives the same meaning as the original function by synchronization, invoking the substitute funcion(run it if assigned) and abort if any error occured(assign non-zero codes to os.Exit(i)). Primary improvement can be lifting up os.Exit(i) just underneath invocation of '_misuse_handler's equivalent assist any mishaps(strings recoverable crash-inducing issues) which indicates successful conversion of original into Go language.
