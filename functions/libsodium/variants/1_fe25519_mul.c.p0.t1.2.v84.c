Here is a program variant that doesn't bring any behavior variance to the original function, instead it changes the order of operations and as a consequence, the executed sequence (or flow) of these operations, changes:


fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int32_t f0 = f[0];
    int32_t f1 = f[1];
    int32_t f2 = f[2];
    int32_t f3 = f[3];
    int32_t f4 = f[4];
    int32_t f5 = f[5];
    int32_t f6 = f[6];
    int32_t f7 = f[7];
    int32_t f8 = f[8];
    int32_t f9 = f[9];

    int32_t g0 = g[0];
    int32_t g1 = g[1];
    int32_t g2 = g[2];
    int32_t g3 = g[3];
    int32_t g4 = g[4];
    int32_t g5 = g[5];
    int32_t g6 = g[6];
    int32_t g7 = g[7];
    int32_t g8 = g[8];
    int32_t g9 = g[9];

    int64_t f0g0    = f0 * (int64_t) g0;
    int64_t f0g1    = f0 * (int64_t) g1;
    int64_t f0g2    = f0 * (int64_t) g2;
    int64_t f0g3    = f0 * (int64_t) g3;
    int64_t f0g4    = f0 * (int64_t) g4;
    int64_t f0g5    = f0 * (int64_t) g5;
    int64_t f0g6    = f0 * (int64_t) g6;
    int64_t f0g7    = f0 * (int64_t) g7;
    int64_t f0g8    = f0 * (int64_t) g8;
    int64_t f0g9    = f0 * (int64_t) g9;

    int32_t g1_19    = 19 * g1;
    int32_t f1_2     = 2 * f1;
 
    int64_t f1g0    = f1 * (int64_t) g0;
    int64_t f1g1_2  = f1_2 * (int64_t) g1;
 
    int32_t g2_19    = 19 * g2;
    int32_t f3_2     = 2 * f3;
 
    int64_t f2g0    = f2 * (int64_t) g0;
    int64_t f3g1_2  = f3_2 * (int64_t) g1;

    int32_t g3_19    = 19 * g3;
    int32_t f5_2     = 2 * f5;
 
    int64_t f3g0    = f3 * (int64_t) g0;
    int64_t f5g1_2  = f5_2 * (int64_t) g1;
 
    ...

Note that all the variable alignment can get back to legacy standard like so in line 51


int32_t g1_19 = 19 * g1; /* 1.959375*2^29 */


So, as summarized, the behavior has not changed at all from the original function, ″just the flow inside it did change″ and the internal structure of the code, that it actually processed only as a hint from the assistant when writing and altering this method of solution.
