The question doesn't provide specific details on how _misuse_handler is defined or what the sodium_crit_enter() or sodium_crit_leave() functions do. Although these codes are from libsodium, we don't have the full context here. 

Also, the function is expected to abort the execution at the end, without changing this we cannot change overall behavior of it significantly. I will assume that sodium_crit_enter() returns an integer - probably a status code -, the function has default access to the _misuse_handler which is a function with void arguments and returns nothing (i.e. void(void)), and retains the behaviour of aborting by the end. I'll encapsulate all the pre-existing statements of the function within try-catch block to deal with unhandled exceptions and thus add more safety.

Here is my solution as per the details:

 
sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    try {
        // Leave sodium critical block
        (void) sodium_crit_leave();

        // Attempt to re-enter sodium critical block & if succeed then...
        if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {

            // Assign _misuse_handler function to the handler
            handler = _misuse_handler;
            
            // If handler function is not null then call that handler function
            if (handler != NULL) {
                handler();
            }
        }
    }
    catch(...) {
        // Exception handler to ensure we handle exceptions and don't leave abruptly
        // This adopted functionality will at least manage unhandled exceptions caused in this function
        std::cerr << "An exception occurred!"; 
    }

    /* Additional step: LOG , if we can */
    std::cout << "ABORT is called!";
    // Explicit system call to abort
    abort();
}

Keep in mind this has certain preconditions going with C++. Though real-world situation will dictate what we modify, and in general trying to increase coverage of C or add exceptions(depending on lang) can have its problems. It might not give the original needs, requirements, resulting from the undefined _misuse_handler and the methods sodium_crit_enter/leave but does add the exception handling functionality which gives a safer way of executing the function while maintaining existing features.
