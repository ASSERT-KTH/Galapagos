The following implementation essentially follows the same functionality as the previous one but streamlines it with for-loops. This approaches cut down on the replication in the code:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int32_t fval[10], gval[10];
    int64_t hval[10], prod[100];
    int i, j;
    
    // Multiply elements of 'g' with 19 as required for computations
    for(i=0; i<10; i++)
    {
        fval[i] = f[i];
        gval[i] = g[i];
        if(i%2 != 0)
            gval[i] *= 19;
    }
    
    // Add additional unsigned int scalars within elements of 'f'
    fval[1] *= 2; fval[3] *= 2; fval[5] *= 2; fval[7] *= 2; fval[9] *= 2;

    // Initialize product elements and carrys to zero
    for(i=0;i<100;i++)
        prod[i] = 0;
   
    // Performing  carries and 26 bit shift operations
    for(i=0; i<10; i++)
        for(j=0; j<10; j++)
            prod[i+j] += fval[i] * (int64_t) gval[j];
    for(i=0; i<10; i++)
    {
        int64_t c;
        c = prod[i] >> 26; prod[i] &= ((int64_t)1<<26) - 1;
        if(i < 9) join[i+1] += c; 
        else prod[0] += 19 * c;
    }
    int64_t carry0 = (hval[0] + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
    hval[0] -= carry0 * ((int64_t) 1L << 26);
    hval[1] += carry0;
   
    h[0] = hval[0];
    h[1] = hval[1];
    h[2] = hval[2];
    h[3] = hval[3];
    h[4] = hval[5];
    h[5] = hval[5];
    h[6] = hval[7];
    h[7] = hval[8];
    h[8] = hval[8];
    h[9] = hval[10];
}

This code reduce the size and increases readability but this assumes that the elements of f and g won't be multiplied by more than 64k and will behave on lower precision hardware as well. Also keep in mind to respect SIMD as optimizing on high performance systems with 256-512 bit vector registers this will not be much effective as compared to the orginal one.
Rephrased calculation sequence ensures no temporary 1.71*2^59 terms appears, also, the previous carry1 and carry2 became moot and were removed as no overflow can happen up to (and including) Fn.
