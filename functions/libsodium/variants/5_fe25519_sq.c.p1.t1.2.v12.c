Sure thing! Here is an alternative of the original code while still maintaining its original core functionality. In this version, I replaced all inline calculations by storing them into handy variable groups first, then reusing those created variable groups in computation phases. This could help increase the readability and easier debugging without hampering the functionality or efficiency:

void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
   uint128_t multiples[5], doubles[2],  cons[5], res[5];
   const uint64_t mask = 0x7ffffffffffffULL;
   uint64_t  carry;
  
   /* Construction phase */
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
   {
       multiples[i] = (uint128_t) f[i];
       if (i < 2) doubles[i] = multiples[i] << 1;
       if (i > 0 && i < 4) cons[i] = 38ULL * multiples[i];
       if (i > 2) cons[i] = 19ULL * multiples[i];
   }

   /* Computation phase */
   res[0] =   multiples[0] * multiples[0] + cons[1] * multiples[4] + cons[2] * multiples[3];
   res[1] = doubles[0] * multiples[1] + cons[2] * multiples[4] + cons[3] * multiples[3];
   res[2] = doubles[0] * multiples[2] +    multiples[1] * multiples[1] + cons[3] * multiples[4];
   res[3] = doubles[0] * multiples[3] +  doubles[1] * multiples[2] + cons[4] * multiples[4];
   res[4] = doubles[0] * multiples[4] +  doubles[1] * multiples[3] +    multiples[2] * multiples[2];

   /* Post computation adjust */
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
   {
       h[i] = ((uint64_t) res[i]) & mask;
       carry  = (uint64_t) (res[i] >> 51);
       /* If it is the last one, then no need to add carry to h[i+1] */
       if (i<4) res[i+1] += carry;

       carry  = ((uint64_t) h[i] >> 51);
       h[i] &= mask;
       h[i]  += ((uint64_t) 19ULL * carry);

       carry  = ((uint64_t) h[i] >> 51);
       h[i] &=  mask;
       if (i<4) h[i+1] += carry;
   }    
}

A similar yet another version was built by dividing this version code's major parts into several blocks for much easier debugging later. It's worth knowing by designing code pleasingly for readability purposes benefits us boost development performance not least amount instantly strongly salting and peppering traceability in code refactoring tweak debugging both workstations.
