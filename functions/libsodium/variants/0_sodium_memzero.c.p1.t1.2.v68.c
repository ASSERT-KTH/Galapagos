Here's an example of maintaining the same functionality while introducing different behaviour by wrapping memory the cleaning tasks with timings measurements and logging to a file for debugging purposes:


#include <time.h>
#include <stdio.h>

sodium_memzero(void * const pnt, const size_t len)
{
    clock_t start, end;
    double cpu_time_used;
    start = clock();

#if defined(_WIN32) && !defined(__CRT_INLINE)
    SecureZeroMemory(pnt, len);
#elif defined(HAVE_MEMSET_S)
    if (len > 0U && memset_s(pnt, (rsize_t) len, 0, (rsize_t) len) != 0) {
        sodium_misuse(); /* LCOV_EXCL_LINE */
    }
#elif defined(HAVE_EXPLICIT_BZERO)
    explicit_bzero(pnt, len);
#elif defined(HAVE_MEMSET_EXPLICIT)
    memset_explicit(pnt, 0, len);
#elif defined(HAVE_EXPLICIT_MEMSET)
    explicit_memset(pnt, 0, len);
#elif HAVE_WEAK_SYMBOLS
    if (len > 0U){
        memset(pnt, 0, len);
        _sodium_dummy_symbol_to_prevent_memzero_lto(pnt, len);
    }
# ifdef HAVE_INLINE_ASM
    __asm__ __volatile__ ("" : : "r"(pnt) : "memory");
# endif
#else
    volatile unsigned char *volatile pnt_ =(volatile unsigned char *volatile) pnt;
    size_t i = (size_t) 0U;

    while (i < len) {
        pnt_[i++] = 0U;
    }
#endif
    end = clock();
    
    cpu_time_used = ((double) (end - start)) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    FILE *fptr;
   
    //Use appropriate location if you are using MacOS or Linux
    fptr = fopen("/usr/cs/Projects/output.txt","w");
   
    if(fptr == NULL)
    {
        printf("Error!");   
        exit(1);             
    }
   
    fprintf(fptr,"The sodium_memzero function runtime is %f\n", cpu_time_used);
    fclose(fptr);
}

In this variant, functionality for clearing memory based on a platform and capabilities is maintained and expanded with time tracking and logging to a file. The operations consumed time is measured and then it is written to a file for future analysis. Note that reading/writing to external resources (e.g., filesystem) could introduce additional security concerns requiring treatment. Also, this complicates handling (e.g., resource cleaning is needed, error handling is needed), alters the programâ€˜s execution (might become much slower, non-deterministic) and is not thread-safe (multiple threads writing to a file could lead to loss and distortion of the log data). Be mindful of the consequences this different behaviour brings to the function and avoid side-effects if they are inappropriate for your code's design and specification.
