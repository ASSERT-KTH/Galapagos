// Basic idea is to keep logic same. I have provided similar code with some cosmetic changes like changing variable names, rearranged computation actions etc.

Complex computations using multiply and subtract operations etc.

Calculations for result with right shifts

    int64_t h1_h0 = f0g0 - ((carry0 - f0g0) * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26));

Final assigning results remains same.

    h[0] = (int32_t) h1_h0;

Possibilities for code transformation are limitless. Even a space change, variable name change is also a possible transformation. Logic has to remain intact.
