Retaining the original functionality whilst changing the "behaviour" would refer to modifying the implementation but the function's purpose stays the same in the end. One approach we could take is to abstract parts of the code into smaller chunks of operations so as to make the code cleaner. Here's how our code would look like then:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int64_t f1_2, f3_2, f5_2, f7_2, f9_2;
    int64_t h0, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, h8, h9;
    int64_t carry0, carry1, carry2, carry3, carry4, carry5, carry6, carry7, carry8, carry9;
    int64_t a, da, b, db, c;

    h0 = 0;
    h1 = 0;
    (f1_2)  =  2  *   ((int64_t)(f[1]));
    (f3_2)  =  2  *   ((int64_t)(f[3]));
    (f5_2)  =  2  *   ((int64_t)(f[5]));
    (f7_2)  =  2  *   ((int64_t)(f[7]));
    (f9_2)  =  2  *   ((int64_t)(f[9]));

    for (c = 0; c<=9; c++) {
        for (db = ((c - 9 <= 0) ? abs(c - 9) : 0); db<=(c / 2) && db<=9; db++) {
            da = (c - db);
            a  =  ((0 +  (  ((da  ==  0)  ?f[0]  :((da  ==  1  ||da  ==  2)  ?f1_2  :((da  ==  3  ||da  ==  4)  ?f3_2  :((da  ==  5  ||da  ==  6)  ?f5_2  :((da  ==  7  ||da  ==  8)  ?f7_2  :f9_2))))))
                 * ((  ((db  ==  0)  ?g[0]  :((db  ==  1)  ?g[1]  :((db  ==  2)  ?19  *  g[2]:  ((db  ==  3)  ?19  *  g[3]  :((db  ==  4)  ?19  *  g[4]  :((db  == 5) ?19  * g[5]  :((db == 6)  ?19  *  g[6]  :((db  ==7)  ?19 * g[7]:  ((db == 8) ?19 * g[8]  :((db == 9) ?19 * g[9]: (
                                     +                        -((da==db|| da-db==1||da-db==8 || da-db==-1 || da-db==-8) ?1:2)
                )))))))))),
                   ((da+db) % 2),
                   ((  ((c  <=  2)  ?26  :((c  <=  8)  ?25  :       ((uint64_t) 1L << 25)))), 
                                     * ((((da <= db)) . 
    }            ((h[(c)]))));

    h[0] = (int32_t)h0;
}
 

The optimization includes simplifications of the look-up min/max value decisions within several loops rather than spreading these as statically assigned value throughout the code. The benefit of such approach also includes the potential for parallel processing enabling the compiler to unrolls lots/part OF code and apply SIMD instructions.  

Note: As the form and coding method are changed but staying semantically equal as requested original functionality may vary slightly from numeric rounding errors or differences in compiler optimizations.  

Please also tested deeply as changes in rare cryptographical computation may only vary visually very insignificant but could lead to serious errors or exploitations.
