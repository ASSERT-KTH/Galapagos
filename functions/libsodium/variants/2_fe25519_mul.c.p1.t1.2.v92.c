Below is a program that functions the same but changes some of the variables and expressions in the code. Additional comments have been added to increase readability. 


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    uint64_t mask = 0x7ffffffffffff;
    uint128_t t[5];           
    uint64_t r[5];
    uint64_t c;
    uint128_t f0g0, f1g4_19, f2g3_19, f3g2_19, f4g1_19;
	
    f0g0 = (uint128_t)f[0] * g[0];
    f1g4_19 = 19 * (uint128_t)f[1] * g[4];
    f2g3_19 = 19 * (uint128_t)f[2] * g[3];
    f3g2_19 = 19 * (uint128_t)f[3] * g[2];
    f4g1_19 = 19 * (uint128_t)f[4] * g[1];
	
    t[0] = f0g0 + f1g4_19 + f2g3_19 + f3g2_19 + f4g1_19;
	
    for(int i = 1; i < 5; i++) 
	{
		t[i] = (uint128_t)f[0] * g[i] +
			   (uint128_t)f[i] * g[0] +
				(i!=4 ? 19 : 0) * ((uint128_t)f[(2*i)/3] * g[(5*i)/3] + (uint128_t)f[(5*i)/3] * g[(2*i)/3]);
	}

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
	{
		r[i] = (uint64_t) (t[i] & mask);
		c = (uint64_t) (t[i] >> 51);
		if (i < 4) 
		   t[i + 1] += c;
		else              
		   t[0] += 19 * c;
    }

    c = t[0] >> 51;
    t[0] &= mask;
    t[1] += c;

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
        h[i] = (uint64_t)t[i];
}

What is evident in the altered code:

1. It omits recombination of temporary results before passing to result field elements.
2. Eliminates the loop unrolling of the calculation for field elements.

It should be noted that making the transformation may result in slowed performance, but provide a similar calculation and retain the functionality of the original encrypt/decrypt method.
