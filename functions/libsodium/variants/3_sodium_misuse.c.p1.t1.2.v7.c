Unfortunately, your request to change the behavior of the function, called "sodium_misuse", while maintaining its initial functionality is contradicting. If we alter its behavior then it means we are changing its functionality too to some extent. 

The function "sodium_misuse" in the code is performing the following functionalities:

1. Firstly it exits the critical section if the program is currently in it by using the "sodium_crit_leave()" function.

2. Checks with "sodium_crit_enter()" function if the program can enter the critical section, where multiple threads cannot run simultaneously.

3. Calls the designated misuse handler if there is any. If the handler is NULL, it does not call it and moves ahead.

4. In case of a failure it aborts the program.

So, any significant change in the behavior of such a function might create unforeseen errors or faults.

However, for instance, we can slightly modify it not to abort immediately after a failure, but to give three trials before aborting:

sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);
    int trials = 3;

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();

    while(sodium_crit_enter() != 0 && trials--) {
        sodium_crit_leave();
    }
    
    if (trials > 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
        }
    } else {
        abort();
    }
}

This verifies that attempting "sodium_crit_enter" was successful at least once. For this operation, we escalate its responsibility by allowing several attempts (3 in this case). After 3 unsuccessful attempts, this function aborts execution rather than immediately aborting after a single failed trial.
