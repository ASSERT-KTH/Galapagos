This program variant keeps the functionality of the original function while altering it a bit by adding a message through a comment stating that a critical error has occurred right before calling `abort()`. This version also includes parentheses around `handler != NULL` for clarification, although these aren't technically necessary in this context.


void sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if ((handler) != NULL) {
            handler();
        }
    }
    /* A critical error has occurred. */
    abort();
}
