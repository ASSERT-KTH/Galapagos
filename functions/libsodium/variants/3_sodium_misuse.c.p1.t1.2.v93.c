Sure, here's a modified version of the function that adds a debug output statement, but does not change the original functionality of the function:


#include <stdio.h>

extern int sodium_crit_enter(void);
extern void sodium_crit_leave(void);
extern void (*_misuse_handler)(void);

void sodium_misuse(void) {
    void (*handler)(void);

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
        }
    }

    /*Debug statement added below. This will show a statement indicating 
      function use each time this function sodium_misuse is used.*/
    fprintf(stderr, "The sodium_misuse function has been called.\n");

    abort();
}

The `fprintf` line is the sole difference and enables debug-oriented purposes. It does not impede on the original instrumental routine.  

This modification can be useful for tracking issues with live code since it's gently adding a marker for each usage without directly interfering besides a string output displayed in case code is debugged. If no debug is performed, the added code is including no side effect on original functionality.

NOTE:

 `_misuse_handler` and `sodium_crit_enter` have prototypes given as their declarations were not presented in the original request. Depending on your codebase, they might need adjustments or could indeed be removed.
