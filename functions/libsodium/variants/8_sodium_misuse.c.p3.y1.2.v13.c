In the Go language, C-like pointer-to-function usage isn't supported the same way. Here's one way of translating the spirit of the C code into Go, using package-level functions:

go
import (
    "os"
    "sync"
)

var sodiumCrit sync.Mutex
var misuseHandler func()

func SodiumMisuse() {
    sodiumCrit.Unlock()
    sodiumCrit.Lock()
    if misuseHandler != nil {
        misuseHandler()
    }

    os.Exit(1)
}


In Go, function signature does not support `(void)` and it defaults to void if no specific return type is stated. `os.Exit()` is used to terminate the program which is equivalent to the `abort()` system call in C. Also, whereas the C code uses a mutex function to manage access (`sodium_crit_leave()`, `sodium_crit_enter()`), in Go we use the built-in concurrency primitives: `sync.Mutex` type has `Lock()` and `Unlock()` methods serving the similar purpose. The package level `misuseHandler` is the closest mapping to `void (*handler)(void)`. It is assumed the handler set-up is done elsewhere in the package. Other exception handling and error control structures are left out as the C code does not use any.
