The program multiplies values of two arrays (f, g) near-250-integer, and carries out subsequent manipulations. The multiplications are performed based on the Distributive Laws of multiplication, i.e., a(b + c + d) = ab + ac + ad.

Here is the variant of the function which maintains its functionality while changing its behavior:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int64_t product[19] = { 0 };
    int32_t carry;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) 
        {
            product[i+j] += (int64_t)f[i] * g[j];
            if (j & 1) 
            {
                product[i+j] += 38 * (int64_t)f[i] * g[9-j];
                product[i+j+1] += 19 * (int64_t)f[i] * g[8-j];
            } 
            else 
            {
                product[i+j] += 19 * (int64_t)f[i] * g[9-j];
                if (j < 8) product[i+j+1] += 19 * (int64_t)f[i] * g[8-j];
            }
        }
    }
    
    product[10] = product[0] + 19 * product[10];
    product[0] = product[10];

    for(size_t i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        carry = product[i] >> 26;
        product[i+1] += carry;
        product[i] -= carry << 26;
        
        carry = product[i] >> 25;
        product[i+1] += carry;
        product[i] -= carry << 25;

        h[i] = product[i];
    }
}

This variant uses nested looping to carry out the loading and remaining intermediate products in a different way. Since looping over the elements in a nested loop keeps manipulating the resulting array, with intermediate sums scaling right away, instead of storing all product results beforehand. This consumes less space and has fewer passes over the data.

However, as both the Distributive Laws and second-degree equations remain the core of this function, this function must continue expressing such propagation of products and sums. Thus, the original functionality is implicitly preserved, henceforth subsequent carries are calculated and accumulated just as given in the earlier function.
