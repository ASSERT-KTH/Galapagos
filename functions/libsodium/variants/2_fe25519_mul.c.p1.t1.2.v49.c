The variant program could reorganize the calculation and re-sequences the variable declaration to optimize runtime execution. Notice that the same calculation design remained but organized differently.

This program could get faster execution due redundancy error involving almost similar calculation waste, but both these functions performs the same job; effectively, but the rearranged and rephrased version possibly optimized version enhanced than the prior original version. It depends on the compiler and settings though
