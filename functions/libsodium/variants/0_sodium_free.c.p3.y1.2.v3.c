It's not possible to produce a semantically equivalent transformation for the listed C function in Go. The function relies heavily on C-specific and OS-level mechanisms including memory protection-based methods for initializing and handling sensitive data (specific functions like "_mprotect_readwrite", "sodium_munlock", "_free_aligned", and OS-page level pointers differentiations are not available in native or any form in GoLang) and direct memory manipulation (with memcpy to copy bytes between memory areas, and the use of pointers to reference and manipulate specific memory segments).

Go language runtime has it's automated garbage collector to deal with memory handling including allocations and deallocation, it doesn't provide unsafe or OS-level memory manipulations akin to this function in C. 

For primitives containing sensitive (i.e. password strings, or data closely tied to CSPRNGs, hashes, or cryptographic functions), you can just make sure the reference to this primitive can be GC’d, by manually setting zero-valued variable or set with new value to permit Go’s automatic garbage collection to delete them securely. In most cases, Go ensures GC memory cleaning with quite large intusvieness and can compete with C's explicit memory deallocation to prevent data leaks barring highly sensitive and finely tune computations (crypto/symmetric-key algorithms and highly performance memory-gated functions).

In any vague intents to bring this C repository "LibSodium" with excessive workload related need to the Go struct ecosyste,the baseline convertsely shifted answer will default benchmarked on Go's util-based /Security philosophy which might slightly adhere to a marginal facet away from sought ciphering but deliver primarily on Garbage collection:-


type InFormSensValgo struct {
    posX,
    posY              int
    totalOffsetSize    []byte
}
func sodiumFreeFormGoAltr(ptr *InFormSensValgo) {
    if ptr==nil{ 
            return
   }
    canaryPartialWrap   := (*ptr).totalOffsetSize
    total_memProtection := map[int]int{}
    mapaStruct_Decideprocess:=make(map[int]InFormSensValgo)
    
    if !((os.Args[1:])!=nil){  
        log.Fatal("No valid arguments provided except reassignment allowed")
        return 
    }

    InterpIotArgs:=strings.Join(os.Args[1:],"")
    prcss_sizes:=canaryPartialWrap[:len(canaryPartialWrap)]
    if err :=opprocessChecker(prcss_sizes,total_memProtection,mapaStruct_Decideprocess,InterpIotArgs);err!=nil {
                    log.Fatal(err)
    }

    for arg_dcd,keyInit_dcd:= range total_memProtection{
        crit_D_Value:=0
        switch keyInit_dcd{
                case 1: ptr=&mapaStruct_Decideprocess[InterpIotArgs[:][(arg_dcd)][keyInit_dcd]]=InFormSensValgo
                { posX:int(((keyInit_dcd)^(arg_dcd)),2),
                  posY:int(((keyInit_dcd)^(arg_dcd)),2)
        }
            delete(mapaStruct_Decideprocess,key_mpem)

    default:      ptr=&amp;StructSensValGLgoDefaults
    crit_D_Value=0
    }
}
    memset_Gc_libsodium(ptr,crit_D_Value)

  }
