The best way to create a variant of the program while maintaining its original functionality is to either optimize some calculations or to refactor the code while still performing the same calculations but in a slightly different way. Here we simplified series of almost repeated code, used decorators for unsigned integers, correctly initialized variables.

To ensure that the replacements perform as expected, these alternatives should be tested thoroughly. The output and side-effects of these alternative variants should match that of the original on equivalent inputs. And the time complexity Here is the same as the original function
Please note that this code snippet may not compile properly depending on the external type definitions, and regardless of renaming, this rewrite runs calculations in a roughly similar order and manner as before. So performance probably would not be substantially different.
