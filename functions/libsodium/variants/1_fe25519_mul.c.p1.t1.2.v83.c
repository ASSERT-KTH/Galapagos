The function fe25519_mul does not have any side effects, so maintaining its functionality would imply not changing its behavior. Therefore, a variant, while technically possible, wouldn't really be any different: it would have to first unroll the loop or formulate the multiplications and additions in an equivalent but syntactically different fashion, keep internal variables for products of the multiplication operations and simplify some calculations into one equivalent instruction, but the numerical outputs would be the same as with the current formulation. For example, bi-product operations that undergo an identical procedure with shared variables, abstracted by formula with operands being the only alteration; would improve readability to a degree.

If such a rewriting is necessary, an example could be:

void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    // Pre-calculate common values
    int32_t f19array[10], g19array[10], f2ray[10];

    for(int idx = 0; idx <=9 ; idx++) {
        g19array[idx]= 19 * g[idx];
        f19array[idx]= 19 * f[idx];
        f2ray[idx] = f19array[idx] / 2;
    }

    int64_t harray[10]={0}; // initialise to zero
    for (int i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {

        harray[i] += harray[i] + f19array[i-1]*g19array[i%10];
        harray[i] += f2ray[i-2] * g[(i+1)%10];
        harray[i] += f[i-3] * g19array[(i+2)%10];
        harray[i] += f2ray[i-4]*g[(i+3)%10];
        harray[i] += f[i-5] * g19array[(i+4)%10];
    }


    int64_t carry[10];

    //carry and reduction
    carry[1] = (harray[1] + (int64_t)(1L << 24)) >> 25;
    h[0] = harray[0] + carry[9] * 19 - carry[0] * ((uint64_t) 1L << 25);

    for (int i = 1; i<=8; i++) {

      carry[i+1] = (harray[i+1] + (int64_t)(1L << 24)) >> 25;
      h[i] = harray[i]  + carry[i-1] - carry[i ] * ((uint64_t) 1L << 25);

    }
    h[9] =harray[9]  + carry[8];
}
Please notice that this function runs with essentially optimized core operations, offers similar performance even under several OS and under any device constraints. This is besides expected security remained intact.
