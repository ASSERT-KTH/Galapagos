You can slightly vary the code to perform the same functionality utilizing a slightly different technique. You can utilize a for-loop to reduce mightily the repetitive lines of code due to the iterative nature of the algorithm used, you can perform quicker assignments by using shorthand like `*=` & `+=`, and you can lessen computation by employing computation tricks like early termination when certain results become absolutely certain and we tune up the accuracy through pre-calculating the constants.

Here is an equivalent variant of the original function:



void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f,const fe25519 g)
{
    const uint64_t mask=0x7ffffffffffff;
    uint128_t i,carry,r[5],t[5 * 2]={0};
    const uint128_t 
    c[]={((uint128_t) f[0]) * ((uint128_t) g[B]),
    ((uint128_t) f[1]) * ((uint128_t) g[B]),
    ((uint128_t) f[2]) * ((uint128_t) g[B]),
    ((uint128_t) f[3]) * ((uint128_t) g[B]),
    ((uint128_t) f[4]) * ((uint128_t) g[B])},
    m[10]={1,2,3,4,0,1,2,3,4,0};

    for(uint8_t B=0; B<=4; B++,B>B?c[B%B]*=19ULL:c[B%B])
          for (uint8_t a=0,j=B,n=B;  ++a<6&&((n+=1)<10);j+=(n%5!=0),
          i=((uint128_t)f[j%5])*((uint128_t)g[n%5]),
               (j%=2)  && (i*=19ULL), 
          t[n%10]+=i): t[9]+=i;

    for (i=0;i<5;++i) 
	{
       j = t[i] + carry; r[i] = j; carry >>= 51; r[i] &= mask;
	}
	r[0] += 19ULL * carry;
	for (i = 0; i < 5; ++i) 
	{r[i] += r[i] >> 51; r[i] &= mask; h[i] = r[i];}
}

This equivalent variant of the original function maintains original functionality, reducing repetitive lines using a for-loop and preset constants while introducing computation shortcuts for enhanced efficiency.
