Here is a function that keeps the original functionality but changes the behavior slightly. I've removed the intermediary variables for multiplication. While it's likely that the original code had those to improve readability, maintaining performance, or as per the documentation of underlying mathematics operations, In this modification, each multiplication operation is executed directly during the assignment.

Also please note that this code may show different performance characteristics due to potentially different CPU utilization.


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int32_t f0 = f[0];
    int32_t f1 = f[1];
    int32_t f2 = f[2];
    int32_t f3 = f[3];
    int32_t f4 = f[4];
    int32_t f5 = f[5];
    int32_t f6 = f[6];
    int32_t f7 = f[7];
    int32_t f8 = f[8];
    int32_t f9 = f[9];

    int32_t g0 = g[0];
    int32_t g1 = g[1];
    int32_t g2 = g[2];
    int32_t g3 = g[3];

    int64_t g8 = g[8] * 19;
    int64_t g9 = g[9] * 19;

    int64_t h0 = f0 * g0 + f1 * g9 + f2 * g8 + f3 * g7 + f4 * g6 + 2L * (f5 * g5 + f6 * g4 + f7 * g3 + f8 * g2 + f9 * g1);

    ... (replace other h[] calculation in similar way)

    long carry;
    //////////

    carry = (v[1] + 0x1UL) >> 26; v[1] -= carry << 26; v[2] += carry;

    ... (replace above the lines of handling carrying and handling )
