In Go, function pointers behave slightly differently and there are no preprocessor commands equivalent to LCOV_EXCL_START or LCOV_EXCL_STOP, so we have procedural comments instead.

Go
import (
	"os"
	"sync"
)

var (
	misuseHandlerMutex sync.Mutex               // Mutex to guard critical section, like sodium_crit_enter/leave
	misuseHandler      func()                   // Go's version equivalent _misuse_handler()
)

func sodiumMisuse() {
	misuseHandlerMutex.Unlock()                 // equivalent to sodium_crit_leave()
	misuseHandlerMutex.Lock()                   // equivalent to  sodium_crit_enter()
	
	if misuseHandler != nil {
		misuseHandler()
	}

	// Go doesn't has a direct equivalent for abort(). os.Exit mimics that functionality
	// but it doesn't guarantee the defer statements to run. There are also no preprocessor
	// commands for code coverage exclusion. Hence, we use procedural comments
	
	// START OMIT: Code Coverage Exclusion
	os.Exit(1)
	// END OMIT: Code Coverage Exclusion
}

In this code, `misuseHandler` mimics `_misuse_handler`. The Go equivalent of the combination of `sodium_crit_leave` and `sodium_crit_enter()` is mutually exclusive Execution of tasks thus `sync.Mutex` (regular Lock and Unlock operations) is used. In Go, `os.Exit(1)` functions similar to `abort()`. For mimicking exclusionary code coverage directives like `/* LCOV_EXCL_START */`, procedural comments are used, as Go does not support preprocessor commands.
