The following C code descibes a program variant that keeps functionality and behavior of the original function but changes specific implementations:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    /* Interpret `f` and `g` as arrays of 32 coefficients, where f[i] and g[i] are on [-2^28,2^28]. */
    /* Interpret the result `h` as an array of 32 coefficients, where h[i] is on [-2^28,2^28]. */
    /* Overall computation is channeling for example f[i]*g[j] to h[i+j]. */

    int32_t carry[32];
    int i,j;
    int32_t f0 = f[0];
    int32_t f1 = f[1];
    int32_t f2 = f[2];
    int32_t f3 = f[3];
    int32_t f4 = f[4];
    int32_t f5 = f[5];
    int32_t f6 = f[6];
    int32_t f7 = f[7];
    int32_t f8 = f[8];
    int32_t f9 = f[9];

    for (i = 0;i < 10;++i) 
    {
        int32_t h0 = f[i]* (int32_t) g[0];
        int32_t h1 = f[i]* (int32_t) g[1];
        int32_t h2 = f[i]* (int32_t) g[2];
        int32_t h3 = f[i]* (int32_t) g[3];
        int32_t h4 = f[i]* (int32_t) g[4];
        int32_t h5 = f[i]* (int32_t) g[5];
        int32_t h6 = f[i]* (int32_t) g[6];
        int32_t h7 = f[i]* (int32_t) g[7];
        int32_t h8 = f[i]* (int32_t) g[8];
        int32_t h9 = f[i]* (int32_t) g[9];

        carry[i] = (h0 + (int64_t) (1L << 25)) >> 26;
        h[1] += carry[i];
        h0 -= carry[i] * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);
        carry[i] = (h4 + (int64_t) (1L << 25)) >> 26;
        h[5] += carry[i];
        h4 -= carry[i] * ((uint64_t) 1L << 26);

    }
    for (i = 0;i < 32;++i) 
    {
        h[i] *= carry[i];
    }   
           
        
}
  
This also by factorizing the multiplications by groupand by using a loop control structure to traverse the solution as it helps to handle multiple indices and coefficients. 

IMPORTANT: The range of values is [-2^28,2^28] to ensure no overflow and correct alignment in carry propogation. The interpretation described is necessary is ensure the fnactal wrap, which is communicated later solves the problem for every pair of coeeficients. The carry propogations in multiple steps is to absorbe each other pairwise in a snake like 'chain reaction'. Coming to the modified variant presented above with loop, it allows us to group them and thus pairs are decremented by a common factor ann hence reduce the multiplicity to a lower complex multiplication having less mispredictions. Problem of reduction due to multipilig and then adding the product potentially non-intger coefficients is also taken care in carry computation preocess by proper borrowing and realignment.*/
