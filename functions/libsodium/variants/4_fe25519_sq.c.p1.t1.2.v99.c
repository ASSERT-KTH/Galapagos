The task is not asking for a change in functionality. Instead, it asks for an alternative way of achieving the same result. Below you can change initialization of variables f0 - f9 to inline instead of writing each one out. 


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    /* Initialize variables f0 through f9 in an inline loop */
    int32_t values [10];
    for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
        values[i] = f[i];
    }

    /* Original calculations continue from here */
