Sure, Here is another version of sodium_bin2hex where the operation of converting binary to hex is done in a slightly different way. The functionality is equivalent to the original implementation.

 c
char *sodium_bin2hex(char *const hex, const size_t hex_maxlen,
                     const unsigned char *const bin, const size_t bin_len)
{
    size_t i = (size_t) 0U;
    unsigned int first_half, second_half;

    if (bin_len >= SIZE_MAX / 2 || hex_maxlen <= bin_len * 2U) {
        sodium_misuse();
    }
    for (i = 0; i < bin_len; i++) {
        second_half = bin[i] & 0xf;
        first_half = bin[i] >> 4;
        hex[i * 2U] = first_half > 9 ? ('a' + first_half - 10) : ('0' + first_half);
        hex[i * 2U + 1U] = second_half > 9 ? ('a' + second_half - 10) : 
                                          ('0' + second_half);
    }
    hex[i * 2U] = '\0';

    return hex;
}


This function works by converting each half of a byte to a corresponding hexadecimal character ('0'..'9', 'a'..'f'), then storing them into the output string sequentially. Adjustment is made to match the position properly. The numeric range is differentiated by checking whether it's greater than 9, if so produce 'a'..'f', if not, produce '0'..'9'. The termination character doesn't change to maintain string standard.
