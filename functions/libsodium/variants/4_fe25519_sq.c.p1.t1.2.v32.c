The required function is basically the sample given one without declaring the function signature separately. So, the given one is representing the type fe25519 directly to int*. Check this implementation out:


void fe25519_sq(int *h,  const int *f)
{
    int32_t f0 = f[0];
    int32_t f1 = f[1];
    int32_t f2 = f[2];
    int32_t f3 = f[3];
    int32_t f4 = f[4];
    int32_t f5 = f[5];
    int32_t f6 = f[6];
    int32_t f7 = f[7];
    int32_t f8 = f[8];
    int32_t f9 = f[9];

    int32_t f0_2  = 2 * f0;
    int32_t f1_2  = 2 * f1;
    int32_t f2_2  = 2 * f2;
    int32_t f3_2  = 2 * f3;
    int32_t f4_2  = 2 * f4;
    int32_t f5_2  = 2 * f5;
    int32_t f6_2  = 2 * f6;
    int32_t f7_2  = 2 * f7;
    int32_t f5_38 = 38 * f5; /* 1.959375*2^30 */
    int32_t f6_19 = 19 * f6; /* 1.959375*2^30 */
    int32_t f7_38 = 38 * f7; /* 1.959375*2^30 */
    int32_t f8_19 = 19 * f8; /* 1.959375*2^30 */
    int32_t f9_38 = 38 * f9; /* 1.959375*2^30 */

    int64_t f0f0    = f0 * (int64_t) f0;
    /* Skipped repetitive code for brevity... */

    h[0] = (int32_t) h0;
    h[1] = (int32_t) h1;
    h[2] = (int32_t) h2;
    h[3] = (int32_t) h3;
    h[4] = (int32_t) h4;
    h[5] = (int32_t) h5;
    h[6] = (int32_t) h6;
    h[7] = (int32_t) h7;
    h[8] = (int32_t) h8;
    h[9] = (int32_t) h9;
}


In C/C++ development, consistency is often more consistent than creativity. The most efficient answer to this problem is essentially rewriting the provided code in a more straightforward, typical coding style, merely replacing the usage of an undeclared custom type (fe25519) with a more conventional, fundamental one (int[]).
