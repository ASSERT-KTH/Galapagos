It's important to note that C and Go handle some things, like memory management and system-level functionality, very differently. Go also lacks some features available directly in C, like function pointers. 

In Go, we could fulfill the same concept by having a global struct variable ("implementation") with a function (let's call it "Bytes") as one of its data members. 

Nevertheless, there're quite a few ways you can implement this functionality in Go; here is a reasoned approach:

go
type randomBytesImplementation struct {
	Bytes func([]byte) error
}

var implementation = &randomBytesImplementation{
	Bytes: func(buf []byte) error {
		// provide the implementation
	},
}

func RandomBytesBuf(buf []byte) {
	if len(buf) > 0 {
		implementation.Bytes(buf) 
	}
}


It's crucial to understand that this Go version is not exactly equivalent to the C version due to profound differences between the two languages. Also pay attention to error handling, e.g., an error could be returned by the Bytes function to report an error during execution. This design deviates from the C-lang style but sticks more to Go's conventions, still achieving a similar objective.
