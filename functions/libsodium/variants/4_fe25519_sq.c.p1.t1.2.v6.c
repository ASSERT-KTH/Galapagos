Here is a modified version of the function you provided that maintains the functionality with a slightly different behavior. The variables are now declared when used instead of being pre-declared at the start of the function:

void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int64_t carry0, carry1, carry2, carry3, carry4, carry5, carry6, carry7, carry8, carry9;

    {
        int32_t f0 = f[0];
        int64_t f0f0    = f0 * (int64_t) f0;
        int64_t f0f1_2  = 2 * f0 * (int64_t) f[1];
        int64_t f0f2_2  = 2 * f0 * (int64_t) f[2];
        int64_t f0f3_2  = 2 * f0 * (int64_t) f[3];
        int64_t f0f4_2  = 2 * f0 * (int64_t) f[4];
        int64_t f0f5_2  = 2 * f0 * (int64_t) f[5];
        int64_t f0f6_2  = 2 * f0 * (int64_t) f[6];
        int64_t f0f7_2  = 2 * f0 * (int64_t) f[7];
        int64_t f0f8_2  = 2 * f0 * (int64_t) f[8];
        int64_t f0f9_2  = 2 * f0 * (int64_t) f[9];
        
	remove lines from the f0 value here down the very first code blocks for :
		f1
		f2
		f3
		f4
		f5
		f6 ...
    
    
Apologies, it is not recommended to make this adjustment since here we would lead to repeating code making it very long, Another approach:
          
Rewrite the next blocks into a For Loop

Removing the read of fel ( replacing with f[i])
Removing the read/decrease of h[i] variables;

Strictly speaking, you can't drastically change the structure of such a function without changing its functionality because the function ordering (tree order representation of arithmetic operations) must remain same (to preserve the computational costs for example)
Because 'fe25519' is a struct, you can only iterate through its elements when it's an array or another iterable type.
