The original function actually deals with secure memory wiping. It uses memset and similar functions destructively and can oppress compiler optimizations that would eliminate "unnecessary" writes to the memory.

Here's the modified alternative that effectively leverages compiler preventions and accomplishes the same result:


void sodium_memzero(void * const pnt, const size_t len)
{
#if defined(_MSC_VER)
    SecureZeroMemory(pnt, len);
#else
    volatile char *volatile pnt_ = (volatile char *volatile) pnt;
    size_t i;

    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        pnt_[i] = 0;
    }
#endif
}

It is understood that you should be watchful of the different memory wipe mechanisms since their implementation behavior may vary. This could have some influence on the transformed memory data; if optimizers or dead store removal tools run firstly, then subsequent memory wipe calls could get suppressed. That's why memory-erasing functions often incorporate a workaround (like invoking a function or intrinsic that has been hinted to shut off dead store optimization). I hope it helps! Please, let me know if you have any questions!

Model-made modifications use `sodium_memzero` inside `_MSC_VER` preprocessor directive instead of `_WIN32` preprocessor directive, and substitute preexisting conditional branching wiped off all the `elifs`.
