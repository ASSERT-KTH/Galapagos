Sure, here is a variant of your function that still maintains its original functionality. Instead of declaring all the variables at the start, it now declares them shortly before they're needed, just to change up the code a bit but keep the same functionality.


fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    uint64_t mask = 0x7ffffffffffffULL;
    uint128_t f0 = (uint128_t) f[0];
    uint128_t f1 = (uint128_t) f[1];
    uint128_t f2 = (uint128_t) f[2];
    uint128_t f3 = (uint128_t) f[3];
    uint128_t f4 = (uint128_t) f[4];

    uint128_t f0_2 = f0 << 1;
    uint128_t f1_2 = f1 << 1;

    uint128_t f1_38 = 38ULL * f1;
    uint128_t f2_38 = 38ULL * f2;
    uint128_t f3_38 = 38ULL * f3;

    uint128_t f3_19 = 19ULL * f3;
    uint128_t f4_19 = 19ULL * f4;

    uint128_t r0 = f0 * f0 + f1_38 * f4 + f2_38 * f3;
    uint128_t r1 = f0_2 * f1 + f2_38 * f4 + f3_19 * f3;
    uint128_t r2 = f0_2 * f2 +    f1 * f1 + f3_38 * f4;
    uint128_t r3 = f0_2 * f3 +  f1_2 * f2 + f4_19 * f4;
    uint128_t r4 = f0_2 * f4 +  f1_2 * f3 +    f2 * f2;

    uint64_t r00 = ((uint64_t) r0) & mask;
    uint64_t carry = (uint64_t) (r0 >> 51);
    r1 += carry;
    uint64_t r01 = ((uint64_t) r1) & mask;
    carry = (uint64_t) (r1 >> 51);
    r2 += carry;
    uint64_t r02 = ((uint64_t) r2) & mask;
    carry = (uint64_t) (r2 >> 51);
    r3 += carry;
    uint64_t r03 = ((uint64_t) r3) & mask;
    carry = (uint64_t) (r3 >> 51);
    r4 += carry;
    uint64_t r04 = ((uint64_t) r4) & mask;
    carry = (uint64_t) (r4 >> 51);
    r00 += 19ULL * carry;
    carry = r00 >> 51;
    r00 &= mask;
    r01 += carry;
    carry = r01 >> 51;
    r01 &= mask;
    r02 += carry;

    h[0] = r00;
    h[1] = r01;
    h[2] = r02;
    h[3] = r03;
    h[4] = r04;
}

The variables here are declared and defined together, but they retain their original function. This change has the same behavior so you shouldn't encounter any issues running the new code.
