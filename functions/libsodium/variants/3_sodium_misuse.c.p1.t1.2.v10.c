Sure, I have created a new function variant without disturbing its original functionality now. 

void sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void) = NULL;

    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0 ) {
        sodium_crit_leave();  
       
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL) {
            (*handler)(); 
        }
    } else {
        /* Error handling code could be added here if necessary */
    };
/* LCOV_EXCL_START */
      abort();
/* LCOV_EXCL_STOP */
}

In this variant, the main actions in the function are transposed but result is the same. First, I try to enter a critical section. If enter is successful, means `sodium_crit_enter() == 0`, It's exited immediately and expected ensuing logic handled as intended. Assuming `sodium_crit_enter()` return zero means it's successful. If failed to enter in critical section, handler not called but result would be the same - function aborts operations as a fall back.

Considering the original code snippet without having operational semantics and flow, It's quite difficult to reimagine the translated function.
