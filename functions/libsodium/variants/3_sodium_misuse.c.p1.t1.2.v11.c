Your task appears to imply wanting redundancy or adding some additional behavior to an already working logic. This could be realistically achieved by adding logging or similar activities, but since output is forbidden, we'll resort to sort of a redundant handling:


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);
    if (sodium_crit_enter() != 0)
    {
        (void) sodium_crit_leave();    
        abort();
    }

    handler = _misuse_handler;
    
    if (handler == NULL)
    {
        (void) sodium_crit_leave();    
        abort();
    }

    handler();
    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    handler = NULL;

    abort();
}

Now, the function respectively fails and aborts if `sodium_crit_enter()` fails to enter a critical section, or if the `_misuse_handler` is null. It will also call `sodium_crit_leave()` after calling the handler, and nullify the handler pointer afterwards for safety, although both those instructions will never actually be executed because of the `abort()` command following the handler call.
