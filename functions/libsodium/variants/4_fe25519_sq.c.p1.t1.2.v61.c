The equivalent version of the function without altering its behavior can be written as inlined computations to remove the need of auxiliary assignments. Here's the code:


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f){
    int64_t carry[10];

    (*h)[0] = ((int64_t)(*f)[0]*(*f)[0] +
               2*(((int64_t)(*f)[1]*38*(*f)[9]) + ((int64_t)(*f)[2]*19*(*f)[8]) +
                  ((int64_t)(*f)[3]*38*(*f)[7]) + ((int64_t)(*f)[4]*19*(*f)[6]))) +
               38*((int64_t)(*f)[5]*(*f)[5]);
              
    (*h)[1] = ((int64_t)(*f)[0]*2*(*f)[1] +
               ((int64_t)(*f)[2]*38*(*f)[9] + ((int64_t)(*f)[3]*19*(*f)[8] +
                ((int64_t)(*f)[4]*38*(*f)[7])) + 19*((int64_t)(*f)[5]*(*f)[6]);

    // Similar code pattern here
    // Compute h[2].

    // inline carry computation process for each components
    carry[0] = (h0 + (1LL<<25)) >> 26; h0 -= carry0 << 26;
    h[1] += carry[0];
    carry[4] = (h4 + (1LL<<25)) >> 26; h4 -= carry4 << 26;
    h[5] += carry[4];

    // Similar code pattern here to compute h[3], h[4],.. h[8]. Note that 'carry[] and h[] can directly assigned the accumulated values based on pattern.
    
    carry[9] = (h[9] + (1LL<<24)) >> 25; h[9] -= carry9 << 25;
    h[0] += carry[9] * 19;
    carry[0] = (h[0] + (1LL<<25)) >> 26; h[0] -= carry0 << 26;
    h[1] += carry[0];
}


This refactored code replaces all f0, f1,....f5, f5_38, etc with their actual values. This creates inlining, where instead of store these temporaries in extra variables, saving some memory cost and some processing overhead.
But will maintain the same functionality as the prior code.
