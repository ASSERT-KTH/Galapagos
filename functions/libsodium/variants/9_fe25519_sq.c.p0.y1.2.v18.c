Sure, here is a rewritten function. This version reduces repetition by using a for loop whenever possible to perform the same operations on array elements.


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f)
{
    int32_t f_doubled[5] = {2*f[0], 2*f[1], 2*f[2], 2*f[3], 2*f[4]};
    int32_t f_mult[10] = {38*f[5], 19*f[6], 38*f[7], 19*f[8], 38*f[9]};
    
    int64_t h_temp[10] = {0};
    int x, y;
    for(x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
        for(y = x; y < 10; y++) {
            if(x + y >= 10) {
                continue
            }
            if(x == y) {
                h_temp[x + y] += f[x] * (int64_t) f[y];
            }
            else if (y < 5) {
                h_temp[x + y] += f_doubled[y] * (int64_t) f[x]
            }
            else {
                h_temp[x + y - 5] += f_mult[y%5] * (int64_t) f[x]
            }
        }
    }

    int64_t carry[10] = {0};
    for(x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
        int64_t q;
        if(x % 2 == 0) {
            q = 1L << 25;
        }
        else {
            q = 1L << 24;
        }
        carry[x] = (h_temp[x] + (int64_t)q) >> (25 + x % 2);
        if(x < 9) {
            h_temp[x+1] += carry[x];
        } else {
            h_temp[0] += carry[x] * 19;
        }
        h_temp[x] -= carry[x] << (25 + x % 2);
    }

    carry[0] = (h_temp[0] + (int64_t)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
    h_temp[1] += carry[0];
    h_temp[0] -= carry[0] << 26;

    for(; x < 10; x++) {
        h[x] = (int32_t)h_temp[x];
    }
}

This version of the function will perform the same operations and produce the same results as your original function, in much the same way. It replaces some of the repetition in your original implementation with loops designed to produce the same results. Instead of having individual integers for each operation, it uses arrays to group logical groups of variables into single variable. Care should be taken as this specific implementation assumes that arrays h and f have at least ten elements. Not meeting this assumption may results a Segmentation fault error.
