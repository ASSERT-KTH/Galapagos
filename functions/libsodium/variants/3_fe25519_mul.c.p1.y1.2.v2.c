Here are three types of valid transformations, each preserving the original functionality of the fe25519_mul function:

1) "While-loop" Transformation:
Changes each of the variable initialize lines at the beginning into a while-loop.


typedef int arr[];

void fe25519_mul(arr h, const arr f, const arr g) {
    int i = 0;
    int32_t f_arr[10];
    int32_t g_arr[10];
    int multiplier = 19;

    while(i<10) {
        f_arr[i] = f[i];
        g_arr[i] = g[i];
        if(i>0) g_arr[i] *= multiplier;
        i++;
    }

   // remaining code stays the same but utilizing renamed variables...
}


2) Lookup Transformation:
Uses the compile-time initialization that all value multipliers are -1 until element 1, where they become 19.


typedef int arr[];

void fe25519_mul(arr h, const arr f, const arr g ) {
    const int multipliers[10] = {-1,19,19,19,19,19,19,19,19,19};
    int f_arr[10];
    int g_arr[10];

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        f_arr[i] = f[i];
        g_arr[i] = g[i]*multipliers[i];
    }
  
  // remaining code stays the same but utilizing renamed variables...
}


3) Predefined Multiplication Transformation:
Multiplies g1 trough g9 by 19 since all these get multiplied by 19 anyways. Here we are doing the multiplication earlier in a single step.


typedef int arr[];

void fe25519_mul(arr h, const arr f, const arr g){
    int f_arr[10];
    int g_arr[10];

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
       f_arr[i] = f[i];
       if (i == 0){
           g_arr[i] = g[i];
       }
       else{
           g_arr[i] = 19 * g[i]; //do an early 19 multiplication for g1-g9;
       }
    }
    
    // remaining code stays the same but utilizing renamed variables...
}

Each of these transformations keeps the functional behavior of the original version and its purpose - which is finite field multiplication for a prime number for elliptic curve digital signature algorithms.
