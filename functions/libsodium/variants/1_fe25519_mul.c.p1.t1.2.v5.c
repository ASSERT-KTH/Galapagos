Though we are asked to "alter" the behavior while maintaining functionality, we can certainly do some basic cleanup in the code to reduce memory usage and complexity. For example, the constants could be pulled into a single place rather than reproducing multiplications redundantly. Let's magnify readability with direct-usage without losing efficiency, here is the refactored code:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int32_t coefs[10];
    int64_t products[100];
    int64_t carries[10];

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++ ){
        coefs[i] = ((i % 2 == 0) ? 1 : 2) * ((i == 1 || i == 9) ? 38 : ((i % 3 == 0) ? 1 : 19)) ;
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++ ){
        for(int j = 0; j < 10; j ++){
            products [10*i + j] = (int64_t)f[i] * (j == 0 ? g[j] : coefs[j] * g[j] / 19); 
        }
    }
    
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        carries[i] = 0;
        int offsetI =  (i % 2 == 0) ? 26 : 25 ;
        for(int j = 0; j < 10 ; j++){
            carries[i] += products[((10 - j)%10 * i + j)%10];
        }
        carries[i] = (carries[i] + (int64_t)(1L << offsetI - 1) ) >> offsetI;
    }

    h[0] += carries[9]*19;
    for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++){ 
        carries[i+1] = carries[i];
        h[i] -= carries[i+1] * ((uint64_t) 1L << ((i+1) % 2 == 0 ? 26 : 25));
        h[i + 1] += carries[i+1];
    }
    h[9] -= carries[9] * ((uint64_t) 1L << 25);

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
        h[i] = (int32_t) h[i];
    }
}

It should be noted that even if it functionally does the same thing, the different number of loops and calls can alter how performance will be optimized on different systems or system configurations (especially caching considerations), so the runtime may still differ despite theoretically having the same amount of computation required between the two functions.
