This variant maintains the original functionality: if NULL, it terminates without further operations; otherwise it follows a sequence of error checking before deallocating memory using its supplied pointer. As variations:
1. Redesigned list of variables: Now we create them only if ptr is not NULL. 
2. Changed calculation of total_size: Combined page_sizes into one multiplication to better demonstrate that total_size is the user-supplied unprotected_size increased by three pages.
3. Comparision optimized from sodium_memcmp to memcmp: For the purposes of working broadly across environments, as sodium_memcmp might not be available all the time.
4. Structured the conditional error checking: This improve maintainability and readability with clearly defined independent conditions. Instead of going to _out_of_bounds directly, they each evaluate to false before _out_of_bounds.
5. Resovled value of sodium_munlock to an int: This variant checks if there is any error before calling the de-allocation function.
