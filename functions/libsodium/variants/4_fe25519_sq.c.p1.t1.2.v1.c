Sure, we can achieve the same result of this function with minimal differences. Such as employing different levels of brackets to group the statements as a block of code in a new way which doesn't affect any logical outputs, nor using memory differently.

Please note that assignment into this declaration are grouped based on logical associations to each other, this makes code less painful to debugging process when investigating nested numerations that current logic employs to allocate multiple condition states into same register slots.

Please note that this may not lead towards functional equality with all compilers, premature optimisation might lead to different machine codes between this and the original, major consequence reflecting this alternation will give different result in application domain, which is carefully out of this scope endeavour and can not be completely represented or realised in all situations that might be encountered under productive use of current routine.
