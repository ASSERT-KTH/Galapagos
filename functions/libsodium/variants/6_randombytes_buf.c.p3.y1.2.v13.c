The direct translation of the C code provided to Golang is improper due to differences in language design and idiomatic usage. A idiomatic Go version of the function provided in C might look like the function provided below:

go
import (
    "crypto/rand"
    "io"
)

func RandomBytesBuf(buf []byte) error {
    if len(buf) > 0 {
        _, err := io.ReadFull(rand.Reader, buf)
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }
    return nil
}


This code does essentially the same thing as the C code. It will fill the provided byte array with random bytes. If there is any error during this process (such as filesystem issues or low entropy), an error will be returned. Since Go emphasizes explicit error handling over "init if needed" side effects, the initial "randombytes_init_if_needed()" function call is not directly translated, but implicitly handled by `rand.Reader`.

It's important to highlight that function signatures in Go are not exactly the same as in C. Parameters in Go are always pass-by-value, so the original void pointer `void*` does not translate. Go does not provide means for unchecked memory manipulation as does C, this means that the buffer in function argument implemented here as Go slice (of bytes) and seems that is manipulated by its reference but actually it accesses through slice header values safely.

The other prominent modification at the function signature was to return an error. Go “comma ok” pattern encourages functions to return an error type upon failure rather than escalating failures via exceptions or allowing failures to lie silent as with a void return type and discarded errors.
