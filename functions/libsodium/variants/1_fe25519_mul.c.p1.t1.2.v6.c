The following altered function will maintain its functionality of multiplication in finite field arithmetic, however, I will slightly alter the function's behavior by randomizing the order of significance for the terms in each h value calculation, while ensuring they remain correct. 

Note that the final result is hard to predict without deep understanding the implementation,  
C code:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g) 
{
    /* Initialization and calculation of necessary helper variables */
    
    // Allocation method and calculation itself does not change.
    
    ... 
  
    /* Calculation of h values - Order of terms in calculation changes */
    h1 = f0g1 + f1g0 + f2g9_19 + f3g8_19 + f4g7_19 + f5g6_19 + f6g5_19 +
        f9g2_19 + f8g3_19 + f7g4_19; // Order change relative to h0
    h2 = f1g1_2 + f0g2 + f2g0 + f3g9_38 + f4g8_19 + f5g7_38 + f6g6_19 +
        f9g3_38 + f8g4_19 + f7g5_38; // Order change
    h3 = f1g2 + f0g3 + f2g1 + f3g0 + f4g9_19 + f5g8_19 + f6g7_19 + f7g6_19 +
        f8g5_19 + f9g4_19; // Order kept same - referential calculation
    h4 = f1g3_2 + f0g4 + f4g0 + f3g1_2 + f2g2 + f5g9_38 + f6g8_19 + f9g5_38 +
        f7g7_38 + f8g6_19; // Order change
    
    ...

    /* Reduction of Helper variables - Order of calculations does not change */
    
    ...
    
    /* Save results - Order does not change */
  
    h[0] = (int32_t) h0;
    h[1] = (int32_t) h1;
    h[2] = (int32_t) h2;
    h[3] = (int32_t) h3;
    h[4] = (int32_t) h4;
    h[5] = (int32_t) h5;
    h[6] = (int32_t) h6;
    h[7] = (int32_t) h7;
    h[8] = (int32_t) h8;
    h[9] = (int32_t) h9;
}


The algorithm complexity remain the same as the initial program. The computation are essentially assumed as associative, because aiming for the the similar calucalation results under increasing permutations. Please notice any modification will not endangers proving of the original statements.
