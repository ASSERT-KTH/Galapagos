The request is asking me to alter the behavior while maintaining its original functionality. It seems paradoxical. Still, a potential way to interpret this is to maintain what the function does at a high level (detect misuse in a sodium library setting and abort if so) but change how it goes about it.

One option is to introduce error checking or a mechanism for logging about what's going on:
 
void sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);
   
    int leave_result = sodium_crit_leave();
    if(leave_result != 0) { // Alteration here by adding Error handling
        perror("Unable to leave safely, terminating with abort due to sodium library misuse.");
        abort(); 
    }

    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
        } else { // Alteration here by adding Error handling
            perror("Null handler found, terminating with abort due to sodium library misuse.");
            abort();
        }
    } else { // Alteration here by adding Error handling
        perror("Unable to reenter safely, terminating with abort due to sodium library misuse.");
        abort();
    }
    abort();
}


Here, the workings of sodium_misuse(void) function undergone certain smaller implicit behavior changes but it still holds to its bigger picture logic -  terminate the program if sodium library misuse is detected.
Although, The comment, /* LCOV_EXCL_START */, included for code coverage tools, excludes the final abort() call from code coverage, stating that it is, in principle, unreachable during tests. All the new abort() introduced also should essentially be unreachable if the function behaves correctly. The addition of these error checking steps represents alterations or embellishments to the implementation without affecting the function's main task.
