This variant maintains the original functionality by utilizing simple for loops to perform multiple similar calculations. This change does not affect the logic of the code, but streamlines calculation. The space complexity is kept minimal with using temporary arrays, and readability is improved by avoiding iterative variables. The product calculation is separated into two nested for-loops that make it easy to conceptualize the equation performed. Furthermore, the dependence on if and else conditional statements in the binary masking, carry calculation's for looping handles stage wise multiplication, thematically grouping the sequence of computations is reduced, fostering an agile code comprehension. However, please note that it may affect performance in regard to time complexity. Because differentiation of 4 & 5 stages operation combinedly handled by mathematical function abs().
