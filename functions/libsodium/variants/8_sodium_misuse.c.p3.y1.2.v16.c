In Go, you can use the "os" and "sync" packages to simulate the behavior of the original C function. Here's how you can do it.

go
import (
    "os"
    "sync"
)

var (
    misuseHandler func()
    critMutex     = &sync.Mutex{}
)

func SodiumMisuse() {
    critMutex.Unlock()
    critMutex.Lock()
    if misuseHandler != nil {
        misuseHandler()
    }

    os.Exit(1)
}


In this Go code, `misuseHandler` is a function that is similar to the handler pointer function of the C code. The `critMutex` is a Mutex that is used to act as `sodium_crit_leave` and `sodium_crit_enter`. If a handler is set, it will call the handler. If not, it just skips. Finally, it calls `os.Exit(1)` to emulate the behavior of `abort()` function from C language. The hardcoded `1` as an argument, is used to indicate that the programm is completed with errors.
