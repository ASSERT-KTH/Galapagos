void sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void) = NULL;

    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        (void) sodium_crit_leave();

        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
            return;
        }
    }
    
    abort(); 
}

This variant has kept the functionality of the previous function, however, it now aborts the program only when the `handler` is NULL or `sodium_crit_enter()` doesn't return 0. In addition, the handler is run only after leaving the critical section making two sections mutually exclusive.
