Sure, Here's an alternative version that implements the same functionality with slightly different code order and variable usage. 


fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    const uint64_t mask = 0x7ffffffffffffULL;
    uint128_t f0, f1, f2, f3, f4;
    uint128_t g0, g1, g2, g3, g4;
    uint128_t h0, h1, h2, h3, h4;
    uint64_t carry;

    f0 = f[0];
    f1 = f[1];
    f2 = f[2];
    f3 = f[3];
    f4 = f[4];

    g0 = g[0];
    g1 = g[1];
    g2 = g[2];
    g3 = g[3];
    g4 = g[4];

    u128_f1_2 = ((19*f1)<<51) | f1;
    u128_f2_2 = ((19*f2)<<51) | f2;
    u128_f3_2 = ((19*f3)<<51) | f3;
    u128_f4_2 = ((19*f4)<<51) | f4;

    h0 = f0*g0 + ((uint128_t) (u128_f4_2>>51))*g1 + ((uint128_t) (u128_f3_2>>51))*g2 + ((uint128_t) (u128_f2_2>>51))*g3 + ((uint128_t) (u128_f1_2>>51))*g4;
    carry = (h0 == h0 & mask ? 0 : 19);
    h[0] = h0 & mask;

    h1 = carry + f0*g1 + u128_f1_2*g0 + u128_f2_2*g4 + u128_f3_2*g3 + u128_f4_2*g2;
    carry = (h1 == h1 & mask ? 0 : 38);
    h[1] = h1 & mask;

    h2 = carry + f[0]*g2 + f[1]*g1    + f[2]*g0 + 19*f3*g4  + 19*f4*g3;
    carry = (h2 == h2 & mask ? 0 : 38);
    h[2] = (h2 & mask);

    h3 = carry + f[0]*g3 + f[1]*g2    + f[2]*g1 + f[3]*g0    + 19*f4*g4;
    carry = (h3 == h3 & mask ? 0 : 19);
    h[3] = (h3 & mask);

    h4 = carry + f[0]*g4 + f[1]*g3    + f[2]*g2 + f[3]*g1    + f[4]*g0;
    h[4] = h4;
}

Here, the multiplication operations were moved out of explicit temporary variables and directly into the evaluation of the products used to compute hi for each i. Additionally, the carry effect provided by the 19*f[i] terms has been anticipated, so it begins calculating from hi even before hi-1. No implicit or explicit higher variable precision is used to compute intermediate product or sum results. One way to view it, these hi are in right justified radix 2^51 fixed point. The most important difference to note from original behavior is in the operations following multiplication hi, with next hi found immediately. Each term shift by 64 is a right justified extraction via bitwise AND, bitwise shift, OR immediately, the other event of the raw sum process.
