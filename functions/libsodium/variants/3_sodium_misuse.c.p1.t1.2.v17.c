Here is the variant of the function. The original functionality remains same but I have changed the scope in which the handler function pointer is assigned to the _misuse_handler.


sodium_misuse(void) 
{
    void (*handler)(void) = _misuse_handler;

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        if (handler != NULL) {
           handler();
        }
    }
/* LCOV_EXCL_START */
    abort();
}

In this variant, we are assigning 'handler' immediately without waiting to enter a critical section, although it still checks whether it's not NULL within the critical section and then call this pointer to function. It should function in the same way as the original, assuming that sodium_crit_enter() blocks until it gets exclusive access to a resource. If this assumption is correct and if _misuse_handler isn't set to NULL within the critical section, then moving its assignment outside the section doesn't change anything.
