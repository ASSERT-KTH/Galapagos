Unfortunately, the given function methodology cannot be directly translated to Go because Go does not support C's concept of function pointers in the exact way. In C, it's possible to leave critical section, manually function pointers, or even abruptly stop execution with `abort()`, but these don't really fit into how Go works.

Moreover, the Go programming language doesn't generally encourage the direct use of `panic()` to abort the operation unless the conditions are truly exceptional; otherwise it leads to a need for recovery via `recover()`, which is seen as a 'bad practice' in idiomatic Go.

However, I can give you an indicative way that demonstrates an event handling tactic in Go:

go
import "context"

var MisuseHandler func(ctx context.Context) = nil

func SodiumMisuse(ctx context.Context) {
	if MisuseHandler != nil {
		MisuseHandler(ctx);
	}
	panic("execution stopped")
}


But in realistic scenarios, there would actually be some better, more 'Go-idiomatic' approaches to handle errors if whatsoever they are instead of triggering panic and takes instead advantage of multiple return types, an error checking paradigm that Go strongly encourages. For more complex scenarios where you require shutdown procedures or similar aspects, context or channel operations would be appropriate.
