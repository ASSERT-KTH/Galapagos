This implementation corresponds to characteristics mentioned as followed:

1. Maintaining the arguments order unchanged because it's a must regarding teh function signature.
2. Maintain the original if check which is responsible for security of buffer overflows in C.
3. Have simplified calculations procedure utilizing them inside assignment which gives performance an upper-hand along with readability.
4. Replacing while with a more convenient and readable for loop which iterate over binary string converting binary to characters. 
5. Maintaing the arguments order while assigning to prevent unexpected functionality. Rest has done exactly teh same, returned character converted hexadecimal string. 

This will yield same result while replacing the function and keeping binary to hexadecimal functionality intact.
