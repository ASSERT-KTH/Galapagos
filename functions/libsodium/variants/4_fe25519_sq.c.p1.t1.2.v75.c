Below is the function variant that's essentially the same logic as the original method but uses loops to process the data. This approach mimics the computation in square-and-multiply algorithms used in number theory, modular exponentiation, and group-based cryptography.

    const int64_t two[10] = {2 * f[0], 2 * f[1], 2 * f[2], 2 * f[3], 2 * f[4], 2 * f[5], 2 * f[6], 2 * f[7], 2 * f[8], 2 * f[9]};
    const int64_t tweaks[5] = {38 * f[5], 19 * f[6], 38 * f[7], 19 * f[8], 38 * f[9]};
    int64_t h_local[10] = {0};

                h_local[j + i] += two[j] * (int64_t) f[i];
            else
                h_local[j+i] += f[j] * f[i];
            h_local[i + j + 5] += tweaks[pos_twice&3] << ((pos_twice&4)>>2);
        }
    }

    {
        carry[i] = (h_local[i] + (int64_t)(262144L)) >> 19;
        if((i&1)==1) 
           h_local[i] -= carry[i] * (uint64_t) 33554432;	
        else 
           h_local[i] -= carry[i] * (uint64_t) 67108864;
        if (i < 9) 	
            h_local[i + 1] += carry[i];
        else 
            h_local[0] += 19 * carry[i];
    }
    
    carry[0] = (h_local[0] + (int64_t)(262144)) >> 19; 	
    h_local[0] -= carry[0] * (uint64_t) 67108864;
    h_local[1] += carry[0];
       
    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)

}


Note though, despite this implementation seemingly processing recursions with loops and striving for readability improvement, it arguably results in less suitable and potentially less efficient production-level cryptography code. Cryptography level C programming, which uses look-up tables, constants, literal representations, explicitly avoids loops, recursion or any optimization that might inadvertently open path or timing vulnerabilities.   

Also, notice that the task about creating variant that changes behavior while maintaining original functionality might represent ambiguity and potentially open debate, as by some computer science definitions change in logic may trigger change in behavior.
