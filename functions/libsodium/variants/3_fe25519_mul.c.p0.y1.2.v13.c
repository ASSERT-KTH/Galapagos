The refactoring optimizes only the repetitive calculations as mentioned and does not do anything to effectively improve the performance inside multiply operations because they are fundamental operations and probably have hardware support. Further, scalar computation seems to be the inherent and unavoidable mechanism here given the semantics and expected return value. Although the distribution of control flow in operations instead of variables may cover best parallel hardware features like SIMD (if available) and seems natural after observing the array elements' in independent calculations along the parallel line.
It is important to note appropriate changes to match original's integer size during roundings and conformity with rest of elements in processing. Some early observation may skip completely unnecessary instructions and they were as such, e.g., unneeded assertions on values limit was removed for this universal sample code.
