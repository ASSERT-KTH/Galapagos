Here, I introduce a for-loop to minimize repetitive and hard-coded elements - and thereby maintain the function's original functionality. Note that this adapted implementation assumes the input arrays f and g are of size 10 and contain int32_t elements (which seems to be the case in your context). Parameters are also added to function signature for clarity:


void fe25519_mul(int32_t* h, const int32_t* f, const int32_t* g)
{
    int32_t f_twice[10], g_multi_19[10];
    int64_t fg[20][10] = {0}, carry[10];

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        g_multi_19[i] = 19 * g[i];
        f_twice[i] = 2 * f[i];
        for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
        {
            if(i+j < 10)
            {
                fg[i+j][j] = (long)f[i] * g[j];
                if(i%2 && j%2)
                    fg[i+j][j] *= 38;
            }
            else if(i+j == 19)
            {
                fg[i+j-10][j] = (long)f_twice[i] * g_multi_19[j];
            }
            else
            {
                fg[i+j-10][j] = (long)f_twice[i-1] * g_multi_19[j-1];
                fg[i+j-9][j-1] = (long)f[i] * g[j];

                if(!(i%2) && !(j%2))
                    fg[i+j-10][j] *= 2;
            }
        }
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
        {
            h[i] += fg[i+j][j];
        }

        if(i == 0 || i == 4)
            carry[i] = (h[i] + (long)(1L << 25)) >> 26;
        else
            carry[i] = (h[i] + (long)(1L << 24)) >> 25;

        if(i<9)
            h[i+1] += carry[i];
        else
            h[0] += carry[i] * 19;
        
        h[i] -= carry[i] * ((i == 0 || i == 4) ? ((int32_t) 1L << 26) : ((int32_t) 1L << 25));
    }

}

This may need more error-checking in a robust application. Every operation spreads-out to different combinations of f's and g's, multiplying them differently depends on if indices are odd or even, hence verifying correct computation in optimized code against the given un-optimised code could be preferred.
