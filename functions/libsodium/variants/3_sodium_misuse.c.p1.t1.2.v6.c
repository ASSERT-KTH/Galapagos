The purpose of this function is to leave the critical section, handle any misuse likely by executing the misuse handler if it exists, re-enter the critical section and then abort. One of the slight changes we can do is to remove unnecessary re-entry to critical section. This version of the function does not gain any advantage of this re-entry and hence, aborting directly after the misuse procedure seems to maintain the critical functionality:


sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    handler = _misuse_handler;
    if (handler != NULL) {
        handler();
    } 

    abort();
}
 
In this case, instead of checking if `sodium_crit_enter() == 0`, we are simply executing `_misuse_handler`, if it is not `NULL`. This ensures the intended action is that the misuse handler is executed and termination of the program through `abort()` happens no matter how the handler executes. It is less reliant on the state of the critical selection, giving it more freedom while still maintaining the termination.
Translating back to english, it says: "Leave the critical section, handle any misuse with the misuse handler (if any) and proactively abort". It can mean fewer operations and again, depends exactly on the misuse handler, ensures termination, which can render "safer" response in robust programming. 

NOTE: Nonetheless, changing the order of sodium critical operations or in other frameworks with different behavior of entering and leaving critical operations could render implementing this pattern vestigial or ineffective.
