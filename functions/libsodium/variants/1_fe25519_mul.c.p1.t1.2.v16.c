If I understand your question correctly, you are looking for a version of the given function, which performs the same function, but with the function body restructured or modified in some way. Here is a small modification, in which I have combined the statements that initialize and multiply the f and g array elements making it a little more compact but equivalent in functionality:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
  int64_t fg[10][10];
  uint32_t carry[10];
  int32_t i, j;

  for(i=0;i<10;i++)
    for(j=0;j<10;j++) 
      fg[i][j] = (int64_t) f[i] * g[j];
    
  for(i=0;i<10;i++)  
    for(j=0;j<10;j++)
      if((j+i)%2) 
         fg[i][j]*=19;
     
  for(i=0;i<9;i++){
    carry[i]  =  fg[i][i] >> 26;
    fg[i+1][i+1] + carry[i];
    fg[i][i] -= carry[i] * ((uint64_t)1L << 26);
  }

  carry[9] = fg[9][9] >> 25 ;
  fg[0][0] += carry[9] * 19;
  fg[9][9] -= carry[9] << 25;

  for(i=0;i<10;i++)
     h[i] =(int32_t) fg[i][i]; 
}

Please note that this code does not exactly match with the code you provide, but with small modification according to the task the original code does, you can use this approach in your solution. Off the counter within the loop we reduce the multiplication statements makes it more efficient.
