Here's a program variant that changes the behavior of the original function:


void sodium_misuse() {
    void (*handler)(void);
    volatile int toggle = 1;

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0 && toggle == 1) { 
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler(); 
            toggle = 0; 
        }
    }
    
    if(toggle == 1) {
       abort(); 
    }
}


The added "toggle" is used to strategically change the behavior: if the handler is NULL or is not executed (meaning `sodium_crit_enter() != 0`), then the program will be aborted, as originally. However, once the handler function is successfully executed, it ensures the "abort()" is not run by updating the "toggle" flag value.
