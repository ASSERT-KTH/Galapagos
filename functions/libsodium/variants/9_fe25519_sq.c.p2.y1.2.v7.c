Here's a variant of the provided code. This variant attempts to combine several operations into a single statement where feasible, while still maintaining the basic functional behaviour.

This variant reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs into script through spelling errors or typos. By performing array accesses through the use of iteration as opposed to individual line statements, this implementation is shorter and concise. It combines different operations into a shorter amount of space while remaining readable. Therefore, it's simpler and has fewer lines of code. Also notice how constants were stored in variables for up and down and how saved intermediate values into the `fProductHo[]` array further simplifying steps throughout arithmetic expressions.
