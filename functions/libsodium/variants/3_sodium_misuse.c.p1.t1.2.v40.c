sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        handler = _misuse_handler;
        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
        }
        else { // If the given handler is NULL, report error, but don't interrupt runtime.
            printf("Error: invalid misuse handler.\n");
        }
    }
/* LCOV_EXCL_START */
    else { // If sodium_crit_enter returned non-zero(empty/corrupted state).
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: Failed to enter critical section.\n");
        return;  // Return without aborting runtime.
    }
}

This variant presents few changes over the original one:

- When _misuse_handler is `NULL`, it handles the issue by reporting the error and allows the rest of the program to go on.
- If `sodium_crit_enter`() doesn't return 0(invalid state), rather than arbitrarily aborting the program, it only prints an error message to stderr and then returns normally.

**Note**: It's vital to clarify that in regions dealing with important resources like a Sodium library(most likely used for cryptographic purposes), throwing an 'abort()` is often intentional to prevent further execution in a potentially compromised state. Therefore, in a real-world system, modifying such behavior carelessly may lead to security vulnerabilities.
