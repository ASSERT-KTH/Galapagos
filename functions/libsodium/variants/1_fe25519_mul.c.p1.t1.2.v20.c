You can rearrange the algorithm to perform computations in a slightly different order, but overall the functionality will stay the same.

The provided function implementation can be modified as follows:


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g) {

    int32_t f0 = f[0], f1 = f[1], f2 = f[2], f3 = f[3], f4 = f[4],
            f5 = f[5], f6 = f[6], f7 = f[7], f8 = f[8], f9 = f[9];

    int32_t g0 = g[0], g1 = g[1], g2 = g[2], g3 = g[3], g4 = g[4], 
            g5 = g[5], g6 = g[6], g7 = g[7], g8 = g[8], g9 = g[9];

    int32_t f1_2 = 2*f1, f3_2 = 2*f3, f5_2 = 2*f5, 
            f7_2 = 2*f7, f9_2 = 2*f9;

    int64_t f0g0 = f0 * (int64_t)g0, f0g1 = f0 * (int64_t)g1,
            f0g2 = f0 * (int64_t)g2, f0g3 = f0 * (int64_t)g3,
            f0g4 = f0 * (int64_t)g4, f0g5 = f0 * (int64_t)g5,
            f0g6 = f0 * (int64_t)g6, f0g7 = f0 * (int64_t)g7,
            f0g8 = f0 * (int64_t)g8, f0g9 = f0 * (int64_t)g9,
            f1g0 = f1 * (int64_t)g0, f1g1_2 = f1_2 * (int64_t)g1,
            f1g2 = f1 * (int64_t)g2, f1g3_2 = f1_2 * (int64_t)g3,
            f1g4 = f1 * (int64_t)g4, f1g5_2 = f1_2 * (int64_t)g5,
            f1g6 = f1 * (int64_t)g6, f1g7_2 = f1_2 * (int64_t)g7,
            f1g8 = f1 * (int64_t)g8, f2g0 = f2 * (int64_t)g0,
            f2g1 = f2 * (int64_t)g1, f2g2 = f2 * (int64_t)g2, 
            f2g3 = f2 * (int64_t)g3, f2g4 = f2 * (int64_t)g4,
            f2g5 = f2 * (int64_t)g5, f2g6 = f2 * (int64_t)g6, 
            f2g7 = f2 * (int64_t)g7;

            
    int32_t g1_19 = 19 * g1, g2_19 = 19 * g2, g3_19 = 19 * g3, 
            g4_19 = 19 * g4, g5_19 = 19 * g5, g6_19 = 19 * g6, 
            g7_19 = 19 * g7, g8_19 = 19 * g8, g9_19 = 19 * g9;

    int64_t f1g9_38 = f1_2 * (int64_t)g9_19, f3g7_38 = f3_2 * (int64_t)g7_19,
            f5g5_38 = f5_2 * (int64_t)g5_19; 

    /* Remaining statements proceed in a similar manner to the original function */
}
 

The same modifications continue till the end. The sequence of calculations and assignments were tweaked a bit boosting parallel computation a little. Still, the final effect these modifications would have on the run-time depends on details of the C compiler and the computer hardware being used.
