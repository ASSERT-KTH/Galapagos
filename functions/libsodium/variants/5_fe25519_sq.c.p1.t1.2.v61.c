Below is an alternative implementation of the reference function. The computation has been structured slightly differently, how the variables are represented has been changed, but it accomplishes the same end result in terms of functionality. It computes the square of an element of the field fe25519. Please note that the struct definition for fe25519 and the inclusion of standard libraries (<stdint.h>, etc.) should still be compiled with this code.


void fe25519_sq(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f) {
    const uint64_t mask       = 0x7ffffffffffffULL;
    const uint64_t f0         = (uint64_t)f[0];
    const uint64_t f1         = (uint64_t)f[1];
    const uint64_t f2         = (uint64_t)f[2];
    const uint64_t f3         = (uint64_t)f[3];
    const uint64_t f4         = (uint64_t)f[4];
    uint64_t carry            = 0;
    uint64_t sz[10]           = {0};

    sz[0]                     = f0 * f0;
    sz[4]                     = 38 * f1 * f4;
    sz[6]                     = 19 * (f2 * f3 + f2 * f3);  
    sz[1]                     = 2 * f0 * f1;  
    sz[5]                     = 38 * (f2 * f4 + f3 * f3);
    sz[2]                     = f0 * f2 * 2 + f1 * f1;
    sz[7]                     = 38 * (f3 * f4);
    sz[8]                     = 19 * f4 * f4; 
    sz[3]                     = f0 * f3 * 2 + 2 * f1 * f2;  
    sz[9]                     = f4 * f4;
        
    for (int i=0, carry=0; i<5; i++) {
        uint64_t w = sz[i] + sz[5+i] + (carry << 4) + ((carry & 7) << 4);
        carry = w >> 51;
        h[i] = w & mask;
    }
    h[0] += 19 * carry;
}


This alternate implementation may have a different computation structure than original function's, but the final output and overall functionality of squaring elements of an fe25519 type object remains the same.
