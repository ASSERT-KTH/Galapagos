Here is a substitute implementation of the sodium_bin2hex function:

char *sodium_bin2hex(char *const hex, const size_t hex_maxlen,
                     const unsigned char *const bin, const size_t bin_len){
    const char *hex_table = "0123456789abcdef";
    
    unsigned char byte;
    size_t i;
    if ( bin_len >= SIZE_MAX/2 || hex_maxlen <= bin_len*2 ){
        sodium_misuse();
    }
    
    for(i = 0; i < bin_len; i++) {
        byte = bin[i];
        hex[i*2] =     hex_table[(byte >> 4) & 0xF];
        hex[i*2 + 1] = hex_table[byte & 0xF];
    }
    
    hex[bin_len*2] = '\0';
  
    return hex;
}

This substitute version achieves the same result, but uses different techniques to accomplish the conversion. Here, a hex table stored as a constant char array is used instead of the arithmetic used in the original function. Then we simply retrieve the conversions from this table and store them in the output hex string with a null terminator added to the end. The performance of both the original code and this rewritten code would be quite similar, and the substitute implementation also provides the same output and behavior as the original. The check for exceeding the string lengths and sodium misuse call are also still included, as they are important parts of its functionality.
