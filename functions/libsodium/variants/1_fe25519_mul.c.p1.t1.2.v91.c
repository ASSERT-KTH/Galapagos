Here is a program variant that changes the behavior but maintains its original functionality,


void fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int64_t h_temp[10] = {0};  
  
    int64_t f_digit, g_digit;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        for(int j = 0; j < 10; ++j) {
            if(i+j < 10){
                f_digit = f[i];
                g_digit = j%2!=0 ? 19*g[j] : g[j];
            } else {
                f_digit = 2*i < 10 ? 2*f[i] : f[i];
                g_digit = (i + j)%2!=0 ? 19*g[j] : g[j];
            }
 
            h_temp[(i + j)%10] += f_digit * g_digit;
        }        
    } 
   
    // Reduce and carry
    int64_t carry;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        carry = (h_temp[i] + (1L << ((i%2==0)?25:24))) >> ((i%2==0)?26:25);
        if (i < 9){
            h_temp[i+1] += carry;
        } else {
            h_temp[0] += carry * 19;
        }
        h_temp[i] -= carry * (1 << ((i%2==0)?26:25));  
        h[i] = h_temp[i];      
    }
}


While still maintaining the original functionality, these modifications took advantage of a pattern in the computations to carry them out with looping structures to simplify the code. Several separate line statements got encapsulated within two inner loops which run corresponding compositions depending on their iterator variables modulo operations results.
