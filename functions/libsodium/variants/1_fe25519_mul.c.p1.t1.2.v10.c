The simplest way to change the behavior of the function while maintaining its original functionality would be modifying the order of some operations that are not dependent on each other. For instance, notice that, in this case, the order in which the variables f0 to f9 and g0 to g9 are initialized does not affect the final values computes for h0 to h9. Hence, we could swap initialization lines involving f and g.

fe25519_mul(fe25519 h, const fe25519 f, const fe25519 g)
{
    int32_t g0 = g[0];
    int32_t f0 = f[0];
    int32_t g1 = g[1];
    int32_t f1 = f[1];
    int32_t g2 = g[2];
    int32_t f2 = f[2];
    int32_t g3 = g[3];
    int32_t f3 = f[3];
    int32_t g4 = g[4];
    int32_t f4 = f[4];
    int32_t g5 = g[5];
    int32_t f5 = f[5];
    int32_t g6 = g[6];
    int32_t f6 = f[6];
    int32_t g7 = g[7];
    int32_t f7 = f[7];
    int32_t g8 = g[8];
    int32_t f8 = f[8];
    int32_t g9 = g[9];
    int32_t f9 = f[9];
  
    int32_t g1_19 = 19 * g1; /* 1.959375*2^29 */
    int32_t g2_19 = 19 * g2; /* 1.959375*2^30; still ok */
    // Continue with the rest of the function without any changes
}elseif(strcmp($usertype,"ln") == 0)
This will produce the same output as the initial implementation, despite its behavioral change.
The preliminary lines here are interchangeable because they involve independent operations and don't interfere with each other. However, the rest of the function encompasses interdependent calculations and needs further investigation if we want to adjust the behavior without altering the functionality.
