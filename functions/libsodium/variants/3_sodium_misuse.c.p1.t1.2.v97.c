The original function's behavior can be slightly altered by adding conditions to trigger different handlers instead of only using _misuse_handler.


void sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*handler)(void);
    int condition = get_custom_condition(); // Fetches some value based on which handler will be called 

    (void) sodium_crit_leave();
    if (sodium_crit_enter() == 0) {
        if (condition == 1) {
            handler = _misuse_handler_1; 
        } 
        else if (condition == 2) {
            handler = _misuse_handler_2;
        } 
        else {
            handler = _misuse_handler; 
        }

        if (handler != NULL) {
            handler();
        }
    }
    abort();
}


In this variant, the function will now decide which handler to call based on the condition set within the function. However, it may not be in best practices to set the condition explicitly inside the sodium_misuse() function. You may need to adapt this according to specific needs; this code serves as a general guide.

(Please replace '_misuse_handler_1', '_misuse_handler_2', and 'get_custom_condition' functions with the actual function names/variables.)
