The original function "sodium_misuse()" protects processing with a critical section by using the "sodium_crit_enter()" and "sodium_crit_leave()" function. It also invokes a function from a pointer and code abortion as function termination. Here is a code version considering the corner cases and polishing the integers into expected boolean:


void sodium_misuse(void)
{
    void (*_handler)(void) = NULL;
    
    do {
       if (sodium_crit_enter()) {
           return;
       }

       if (_handler = _misuse_handler) {
            _handler();
       }
       
       if (sodium_crit_leave()) {
            return;
       }

    } while (!_handler);
    
    // If control reaches here, terminate abnormally
    abort();
}


This code also behaves very similar to the original code except that it checks for edge cases by considering "sodium_crit_enter()" and "sodium_crit_leave()" may return non-zero values indicate an error. It uses a "do...while" loop for pointing the handler until success, finally if everything fails it will call "abort()" for code termination by runtime error similar to SIGABRT signal behavior.
